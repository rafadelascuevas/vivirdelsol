"Cheer up, meat bag. You barely touched your amoeba. I just don't feel like eating. You want it? Nah, I'm watching my input. I need lots of wholesome, nutritious alcohol.

Here's where you'll live… which is great because it's been wasted space. It's cramped. I don't even have room to hang my clothes. You've got one set of clothes… and you're not taking them off while I'm here. Well, I'm bushed. Good night. Wait, Bender. Bender? Kill all humans, kill all humans.",

We're cheerful this morning. This week with Fry's been a blast. Beneath the warm, sunny exterior beats the cold, mechanical heart of a robot. What happened? It's Bender's apartment. He put in carpeting. Now, my head hits the ceiling. Do you realize you're standing at a weird angle? Now you're okay. You're a wreck.",
"You have to find a new place. Is that an invitation? Love your optimism. Seriously, you must tell Bender you're moving out. I can't do that to him. Hey, there's my little space heater. Well, I'm moving out. I'm sorry, but there's not enough room. Not enough room? My place is two cubic meters and we only take up 1.5. We have room for another two-thirds of a person! find a bigger place? I don't know. I've got a lot of great memories in my old place. And now they're gone. Sure, it ain't one of them la-di-da aboveground places.",

Sad, sad, terrible, gruesome news about my colleague, Dr. Mobootu. Was his apartment rent-controlled? What's with the crap? It's not crap.",
"Dr. Mobootu collected this crap while he explored the universe. This place has everything but the thing I care about, a TV. It's got a TV, you young Slow down! This place just doesn't feel like home. It just isn't cozy. I can barely move. It's perfect! Man, it's a total sty! For the first time in years, It's gonna be fun on the bun.

If Calculon's wedding doesn't go just right… I'll be emotionally and electrically drained. These are mighty tasty. Thank you. I made them myself. The wedding's about to start. If anyone here objects to this union, let them speak now or forever hold. Is he objecting or backing up? My half brother is correct.",
"I have a terrible secret. And that secret is. Oh, come on! What happened to the TV? It went out. This is an outrage! I'm gonna go yell at the manager! All right! Come back, Bender! It's working. To reiterate, my terrible secret is. It's out again. What? That's the last straw. It's back on! I don't mean to pry into what you're doing… with the one-eyed lady and Chinese girl… but everyone's having trouble with their reception. Get rid of what's causing it or we're out of this dump! Relax, sonny.",

Those could be anyone's The robot has to go! Well, you heard the mob. Fine! apartment that smelled. You liked that one. It's tempting, but I am already kind of settled in here.",
"We can live underground with mutants. Some fire'll show them who's boss. Is there maybe some way we could do this with you going and me not going? I don't understand. You live in the closet. You'll be as happy in your old place. But we wouldn't be roommates. And you can visit me here. No, he can't! Anyway, it'll work out. Happy. Yeah, that's Bender. Hey! The TV's back on! We are gathered to mourn Calculon's death… industrialist, private eye, friend. Mind if I give the eulogy? Calculon, you're alive! Calculon's back! Right.",
"So long. Will Calculon's evil twin ever walk again? I don't know, Amy. I just don't know. Hey, thanks for coming. kick Bender out? Come on. Bender loves mobs. When he's in them. You really hurt his feelings. Don't girl me with that girl stuff. We're guys. Guys don't have feelings. Bender's not a guy; he's a robot. Same thing. It's so big and empty. My roommate's gone. All he left behind was an eyelash and three skin flakes. What's the point? Bender? My God, you're a mess! Leave me alone.",
"Look at that five o'clock rust. You've been up not drinking. Hey, what I don't do is none of your business! Please have a malt liquor, if not for you, for those who love you. and they hate me. being Fry's roommate. There's a better way Having my antenna removed? Well, if that would work. You crazy? That's Little Bender you're talking about! I can't cut it! You're not a robot or a man, so you wouldn't understand. I gotta get out of here. Wait, look at me and promise you won't get behind the wheel.",
"I promise nothing! I can't be silent about Bender anymore. Silent? You've been meddling for two weeks. I can't just do that. Your best friend's out there destroying himself. I didn't think he'd miss this apartment that much. He doesn't. He cares about you. And you turned your back on him. Oh, man, I had no idea. If only I knew where he was, I'd go talk to him. You're blind, stinking sober! Right! I'm sober and crazy and I don't know what I might do! Don't do it! I don't know what it is! Oh, yeah, now I remember.",
"So, I'm gonna do what it takes to be your roommate again. Cutting her head off won't help! No, I'm gonna chop off my antenna. Hey, yeah, that sounds good. Can I give you a hand? Don't help him mutilate himself! It's a useless antenna. He's not a ham radio. I'm gonna do it, I'm really gonna do it! Don't try and stop me! Here goes! Hey, it worked! The static's gone! I hate that this came between us. I'm filled with a large number of powerful emotions. You're my best friend.",
"Sorry I treated you badly. After all, you're only human. You guys could learn from them. She's right. You're my best friend, Fry. I'm sorry I treated you so badly. After all, you're only human. Wait a minute. You did it all backwards. Fry's the one who should be. Oh, never mind. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm just gonna have to get used to being half a robot. This isn't right. If we found your antenna, could they reattach it? Maybe, if we get it on ice right away. Bingo! You call that an antenna? the human comforts.",
"It sure is. I saved your stuff. So that's where those skin flakes went. Will this tree get enough light? The closet has a window. This is huge! Bender, why don't I just live in here? In a closet? Oh, humans. SDI Media Group What a great choice. Amazing food! And such generous portions. Just wait till you try the mints. Doug, most guys are put off by my eye. It's nice to meet someone open-minded. Love's Labour Lost in Space What went wrong last night? I don't know.",
"I couldn't put my finger on it. Possibly his vile lizard tongue. You're too picky. If you rule out every guy with a lizard tongue or low I. Q… or a temper, you're gonna be lonely. There's nothing wrong with having high standards. Leela's problem is purely medical. She'll drop her eggs. They'll hatch and all will be well. Give guys a chance. You think a guy is a pig, but then you realize he has a good body. Thank you for the inspiring advice. That sounds like a cry for help.",
"There's great places to meet people. The Sex Bureau. A rotting whale carcass. Oh, wow! It's totally retro! Why's everyone wearing rings? Because nobody wears them anymore. Rings are stupid. Don't let anyone hear you! Did he say rings are cool? No, he said they're stupid. What do you think of that guy? I don't know. Maybe. Forget it. He's gay. What? How can you tell? I just know these things. I've got gaydar. There's no such thing. Okay, I got a lock on him. Are you sure? Definitely! Or it's interference from a gay weather balloon.",
"You're from the 20th century? That's incredible. I'm from the 21 st! We've got so much in common! We sure do. Remember when the cyborgs enslaved humanity? Yeah! That rings a bell. This is Bolt Rolands. He's a hyper-sled racer with 10 wins on the pro circuit. I think she means 10 wins on the gay circuit. I wish. Those cats can really fly. an entity of pure energy. Great. But he's just not what I'm looking for. I understand. One day you will evolve beyond your physical body. And on that day, I hope you will pick up the phone.",
"You're impossible. He comes from a dimension… that's big on musical theater. I need the apartment. Can do! Oh, my! I'm sorry! Leela, you must've had your pick last night at closing time. Could you stop talking about my personal life? Leela's personal life later. We have business to attend to. A delivery? A tax-deductible mission of charity. This is Vergon 6. This is Vergon 6. It's a sunny little doomed planet inhabited by frisky, doomed animals. Animals? That's right. Animals in need of rescue.",
"Vergon 6 was once filled with the dense substance Dark Matter. Each pound of it weighs over Wait. What about the animals? Well, Dark Matter is valuable as starship fuel. That's why it was mined out, leaving the planet hollow. But what about the animals? The animals. I didn't mention animals. The planet will collapse within three days. This will kill all the animals. We have to save two of each kind. Like Noah's Ark. I bet Leela's holding out for a one-eyed guy. That'll take forever.",
"She ought to find a guy with two eyes and poke one out. That'd be a timesaver. Do you mind? You can use this as a poker. Thanks, if it's less than five, I don't care how many eyes he has. I want a guy who's adventurous, self- confident, maybe a snappy dresser. These new uniforms are snappy, first officer. I suppose, captain. I'm not a big fan of velour as you are. What do you want Destroy them! That's got a nice feel to it. Captain's journal. Who are you talking to? You.",
"Aren't you getting this? A vessel is attempting to break the security cordon around Vergon 6. I'm anticipating a tactical dogfight, followed by a light dinner. Ravioli, ham, sundae bar. Hey, look! Zapp Brannigan's ship. Wow! The Zapp Brannigan? Who's the Zapp Brannigan? Shall I fire on them now, sir? In the game of chess, never let your adversary see your pieces. Zapp Brannigan alone saved the Octillion System… from rampaging Killbots. A grim day for robot-kind. But we can build more Killbots! He's the most decorated captain in the Order of Planets.",
"Leela's got a boyfriend! if he'll help us rescue those animals. In case you hit it off, you'll want to take this with you. They're headed for us. A calculated move out of Sun Tzu's classic text, The Art of War. Or my own masterwork, Zapp Brannigan's Big Book of War. The one thing their captain doesn't realize is. They've docked and come aboard. Then I've risked all and lost. I'll be in the escape pod. If that wicker chair I like survives, have it sent to my P. O. box. I'm Leela, captain of the Planet Express delivery ship.",
"We're pleading for assistance. If there's. I'm in command. Zapp Brannigan. Has my fame preceded me, or was I too quick? Oh, not at all. I'm just so really thrilled You're an impressive captain, beautiful and deadly. A potent combination. You don't mean that. I haven't seen more than three captains sexier than you. Only one who was deadlier. I heard you defeated a horde… of somethings in the something system. Simply a matter of outsmarting them. I never would've thought of that.",
"Killbots have a preset kill limit. Knowing that, I sent wave after wave of my own men at them… until they shut down. Kif, show them the medal I won. More, please. A little more. More. Keep going. We need to talk about our mission. I'm willing to put wave after wave… of men at your disposal. Right, men? We're hoping to save the animals of Vergon 6. Vergon 6! This dinner is over. What's wrong? The Order of Planets prohibits interfering with other worlds. It's a little rule known as Brannigan's Law.",
"People already interfered. That planet was mined hollow. By an Order of Planets mining crew. This doesn't make any sense. I don't pretend to understand Brannigan's Law. I enforce it. Fine, we'll save the animals alone. I'm afraid I can't allow that. Guards! What just happened? He's throwing us in prison. Dang! Can I get this wrapped up? hadn't thrown me in prison. You really are too picky. I've got some musing to do. I'm facing a formidable female adversary. Suggestions? I fail to see any problem, sir.",
"You've imprisoned her under directive B-10. 81. You mean Brannigan's Law? Which one? Brannigan's Law. You're my best friend, but you've earned my contempt again. You should know, the way to deal… with a female adversary is to seduce her. This time we are sure she's a woman? Invite her to my quarters. And have the boy lay out my formal shorts. The boy, sir? You. You lay out my formal shorts. The jackass wants to see you in his quarters. Now's my chance to reason with him, captain to captain.",
"And he wants you to wear this. Come and get it! Welcome to my humble chamber. Or as I call it, The Love-Nasium. Cham-pag-in? You're such a coin-a-sewer. Well, I have studied abroad. Or two. Captain? If we could speak seriously. Please let us rescue those animals. I like your style. I find it very erotic. Erotic! We can escape. Just bend You look like a woman who enjoys the finer things. Come over here and feel my velour bedspread. I'm not in the mood. Leela, it's real velour.",
"Just let yourself go. Can I please just go back to prison? You'd rather sit in prison than spend time with the Zapper? Much rather. What are you doing? Sorry. Just go. You want the cham-pag-in? No. And it's pronounced champagne. Oh, God, no! It's not a big deal. I get so lonely. I just thought a fellow captain would understand. Oh, forget it. It's great ordering people around. But through it all, you're completely alone. I'm just so lonely! Oh, come on. Cheer up. It's not that bad.",
"Want to try escaping again? Leela's been gone a long time. I hope she's making progress Good morning, lover. Listen. Now you're officially my woman. Kudos! I can't say I don't envy you. Last night was a mistake. No, just a regular mistake. For a second my common sense was overwhelmed by pity. A second is all it takes. That's why eventually you'll come crawling back to the Zapper. The only kind of crawling I'm doing to you is away. from. Leela, you're obviously confused and aroused.",
"I'm going to Vergon 6 to save those animals, like it or not! I won't stop you. Threaten all you. What? We both know you won't make it to Vergon 6 before the craving sets in. Then you'll come crawling back for another taste of sweet candy. Yes, captain? I have made it with a woman. Inform the men. The fatso says you're free to go. Why, indeed. Nothing. Should we go and head to the planet? We don't have much time. The planet is supposed to collapse in. Two hours ago. Hello, there.",
"He's not on the list. So we can cook him? A barbecue! I'll wear my funny apron! No! I don't care about your apron, we're not cooking him. I'll call him Nibbler. I'll fire up the grill. with all those big animals. Once my woman returns, I won't have time to hang with the boys anymore. That's a shame, sir. of our time together. Never mind. Just give me a back rub. I found some hermaphlamingos. Where'd they all go? I can't believe we flew across the galaxy and had a steam…",
"He's pending for a Bending. It's not his fault he's an unstoppable killing machine. Is it, snookums? The planet's kerr-ploding! Prepare for liftoff. We're out of fuel! Bender, I told you to fill the tank. I'll do it when we get back. Lucky for us Zapp Brannigan's nearby. Forget it! I refuse to go crawling back to him. What do you mean? Nothing. We just talked. So? It's not like you slept with him. I thought you had standards! Jeez, he's a dumb, gross gorilla! Don't you think I feel bad enough already? All right, I'll call him.",
"If living is that important to you, that's why you'll never make captain. Zapp, we're out of fuel. Vergon 6 is about to implode. We need help. So, crawling back to the Big Z like a bird on its belly. Delicious. Birds don't crawl. They've been known to! Are you gonna rescue us or not? Can't you ask a bit more sexfully? But first you have to get rid of that thing. Brannigan's Law is like Brannigan's love. Hard and fast. Now put that greasy rat outside and we'll tow you. I'd never abandon a helpless animal.",
"You know, once I thought you were a pompous buffoon. Then I realized that inside you were a child. Now I realize that outside that child is a pompous buffoon! And which one rocked your world? What's your escape plan? I guess to sit here and wait for death. Can do! I don't believe it! It's Dark Matter! So this guy just unloaded a steaming pile of starship fuel? filled the planet with it. That should be enough fuel Bender, put it in the engine. And some of the animals survived! So a couple animals didn't die and Leela got lucky.",
"A successful mission. We're heroes! Dear diaryI didn't find love on this mission… but I did find a cute little companion who excretes fuel. And that's just as good. Captain's journal, Stardate April 13th. Point-two. However, I did make it with a hot alien babe. And in the end, is that not what man has dreamt of… since first he looked up at the stars? Kif, I'm asking you a question. SDI Media Group What about the view, Fry? It really puts things in perspective.",
"From up here, an entire world can seem utterly insignificant. Fear of a'Bot Planet Nice seats! We're close enough… to when you hit a player with a bottle, he's down. I don't get it. Is blernsball Baseball? God forbid. Face it, Fry. Baseball was as boring as mom and apple pie. Boring? Baseball wasn't. So they finally jazzed it up. Home run! What happened? Why's the ball on that spring? It's tradition, like aluminum bats and the seventh-inning grope. I got me a souvenir! Here you go, kid.",
"We don't sell those. All right. Let me have one of your young on a roll. We're out of rolls. Fine. Just give me something crawling with parasites. At least hot dogs didn't change. Buddies, who wants popcorn? Anyone want butter on that? I'm getting the hang of this. The blerns are loaded… count's 3 blerns, 2 anti-blerns, and the blern rule's in effect, right? Except for the word blern, that's total gibberish. Blern! Blern! All right! Yes! Miller's on a pace to hit 70 blerns.",
"He's good, all right. But he's no Clem Johnson. And Johnson played back in the days before steroids were mandatory. That sack of skin wouldn't have lasted one pitch in the old Robot Leagues. Now, Wireless Joe Jackson, there was a blern-hitting machine. Exactly. He was a machine designed to hit blerns. Wireless Joe was a programmable bat on wheels. And I suppose pitching at 5000 was just a modified howitzer? Humans are so scared of robot competition, you won't let us on the field.",
"There's a lot of robots down there. Yeah. Doing crap work. They're batboys, ball polishers, sprinkler systems. But how many robot managers are there? Eleven? Zero! And what a surprise! Look who's scraping up the filth! Is it a human child? I wish! Whoa, dear Lord! What's wrong? It's my new pager. This is Hermes. A package just came in. Return to the office immediately. Get away, you filthy bird. Professor? Turn me off, quick! I'm sorry. What? You think robots are just machines built to make life easier.",
"Well, aren't they? I've never made anyone's life easier, and you know it! Great news, everyone. You'll be delivering a package to Chapek 9. Where humans are killed on sight. Why is that great news? I'm glad you asked that question. You see, Chapek 9 was colonized centuries ago… by a murderous crew of radical robot separatists. Just because a robot wants to kill humans, he's a radical. Hold on. I understand these robots hate humans. about humanoid aliens? They're not fans.",
"Bender will have to make the delivery. Make the robot do all the work. This is the first actual work you've ever done here. Well, I'm not doing it! It's a robot holiday. Really? Which one? Only Robanukah. The holiest two weeks on the robot calendar. Come on, Bender. Last month, it was Robomadom. And before that, Robonza. Man, that one was a blast, it was a sacred tribute to my ancestral prototypes… which took the form of a drinking contest. Bender, I respect your diversity to the extent the law requires.",
"But you used all your days off when you had Roberculosis. All right, I'll go. But I'll hold a grudge against every last one of you… for the rest of your lives. Well then, it's settled. So long, everyone. So, this planet is completely uninhabited? No. It's inhabited by robots. Kind of like how a warehouse is inhabited by boxes. Okay, Bender. Time to get to work. Tote that space barge. We can't land on the surface, the robots will kill us. We'll stay and lower you with the winch.",
"Remember, you don't know humans, you don't work for humans… and above all, you don't like humans. I'll try to keep that in mind. He seems pretty angry. I'd be angry too, if I had to go to an uninhabited planet. Let's do something nice for him. There. robot we care. Bender's done with the delivery, I'm in trouble. They found out I work with humans and- Oh, no! My God! We have to rescue him. I don't know. It's not an easy decision. If only I had two or three minutes to think.",
"To save Bender, we've got to look and act exactly like robots. I'm fully operational. We have to walk and talk like robots, and maybe… solve differential equations like robots. I can dance like a robot. Fry. First of all, this is serious. Second of allgotten store-bought costumes. But there's no Woolworth's nearby. Be you robot or human? Just two robots out roboting it up. Administer the test. Which of the following would you most preferA pretty flower from your sweetie? Or A large, properly formatted Is the puppy mechanical at all? No.",
"It's the bad kind of puppy. Correct. The flower would've been acceptable. If you see robots, stay out of their way. So far, so good. Little to the right. Okay. Have you seen this robot? Sorry. Can't help you. Don't drop that there! Come on, Fry. Walk like a robot. I have to go to the bathroom. Robots don't have bathrooms. Right. Where do they smoke in high school? Just go behind those garbage cans. I'll stand guard. Hurry up, Fry! Sir? Are you aware you're leaking coolant at an alarming rate? Let me patch you up with hot resin.",
"I think the leak's stopping. Yeah, there we go. What sort of robot turns down a free blast of searing-hot resin? I'm sorry. My friend and I have to do some mindless, repetitive tasks. Sounds like a romantic evening. I won't keep you. Get the humanoids. Get the intruder. Intruder alert. Quick! Let's duck in here! We interrupt this sound file for an announcementA nonmetallic being is in the vicinity of Make-Out Point. Say, Wendy? Your chassis's scuffed. Mind if I polish it for you? Did you hear that? It sounded like a human.",
"Relax, Wendy. Humans will never come to our little town. It's perfectly safe to let our guard down. I will eat and digest you all with my system of mighty organs! Wow! The 3-D's great! Mine's not working. Funny, isn't it? The human's impervious to our powerful magnetic fields. Yet in the end, he succumbed to a harmless sharpened stick. I'm glad the nightmare's over. It'll never be over. Even now, humans lurk in our playgrounds, breezeways… perhaps even our movie theaters! Okay.",
"Keep an eye out for Bender. What did you think of the movie? Too much romance, not enough human killing. It was a real chick flick. What do you mean, What's that? Time for the daily human hunt. Stay with the crowd so no one sees how crummy you look. That was uncalled for. I'm over here. I heard a human was draining coolant behind garbage can 738. I heard they unscrew our lug nuts at night and eat them at brunches. Welcome to a very special human hunt. irrational hatred for humans.",
"A human sympathizer. A newly-arrived refugee from Earth, let's hear it for… Bender! Death to the humans! Ah, it's good to hear his voice. Many said I was too extreme when I called for… the annihilation of humans… as well as some of the more cunning monkeys. After living on Earth, I can tell you that I am, if anything… too merciful. I mean, eviler. Thank you. And if you enjoyed that diatribe… you'll want to purchase my spoken-word album.",
"Act now, and you'll get this Bender action figurine. Bite my shiny metal ass. Let the hunt begin! Now, your basic human is between three and 25 feet tall… and is made of a hairy, oily goo in a T-shirt. Suck your fluid. And you become human? Sure. Anything in the trap? Nothing. Nothing. Humans prefer low-calorie bait. unsuccessful hunts in a row. But I've got a good feeling about tomorrow. That's the abandoned adult-book store. Nothing there, except a few shreds of old robot pornography.",
"Sounds like a breeding ground for humans. I'll check it out. You're a bad girl, aren't you? Psst, Bender! What are you doing here? Looking for you. We heard you were arrested as a human sympathizer. They let me go when I said I killed a billion humans. What for? We're rescuing you. I don't want that. I love this planet and access to the depths of sleaze from that. But we're your friends. Friends? That activates my hilarity unit. I'm a machine. You're no more my friends.",
"Bye, Bender. I'll miss you. Go on. Get out of here before you get caught. Bender, good news. Your album just went gold. It's the humans! Bender, do something! Got you! You murderous flesh piles! These humans are guilty of the crime of being humans. Come to think of it, I rest my case. Thank you, prosecutor. I will now consider the evidence.",
"Wait a minute. Won't someone defend us? Yeah! He may not have a case, but I am genuinely not a human. Quiet, human! He froze up again. Try control-alt-delete. Jiggle the cord. Turn him off and on. Clean the mouse. Call technical support! Okay, okay, he's back online. I find the defendants guilty. Look, one eye! Count them! One! Not human! The humans are sentenced to live as robots live on Earth. They'll perform tedious calculations and spot-weld cars… until they become obsolete, and given to an inner-city school.",
"Great work, Bender! You've taught us to hate humans all over again! Are you all right? Who are you? We are the Robot Elders. You don't look old. Thanks. We try to take care of ourselves. What's going on? Silence! Bring in Bender! at a mini-mall opening. Silence! It's time to kill the humans. But the judge sentenced us! Silence! That's just a show for the public. We rule this planet. Handcarved from meteorites by robot founders over four centuries ago. Silence! Come forward, Bender.",
"You'll have the honor of execution. Silence! I concur. Here. Use the ceremonial I'm a little tired right now. Can I just give them a savage beating? No! The elders have spoken. Show us the killing skills that made you a media darling. Do it! Kill them before they bring down our society! I can't kill them. Plenty of humans have mistreated robots, but not these two. They're my friends. Humans are no threat to us. They're stupid, putrid cowards. Damn right! The fact is, humans are completely harmless.",
"We're well aware of that. You are? We use them as scapegoats to distract the public from their real problems. Like our crippling lug nut shortage. And a corrupt government of robot elders. That's for sure. I'm glad that's out in the open. We'll just let ourselves out. Silence! You all know too much. Elders? Execute function control, Take one more step, and I'll breathe fire on you! He'll do it! He's crazy! Gee, I can't remember anymore. It might be from that stupid movie. The original or the remake? Hey! They're getting away! So long, suckers! Hello, suckers.",
"Hold on. I forgot to deliver the package. Lug nuts! Precious lug nuts! Hooray for the humans! I can't believe you guys did this for me. This is the best Robanukah ever! We want you to know that we respect your robot heritage. Thanks. You know I made Robanukah up to get out of work, right? Of course. That doesn't make it less meaningful. In that case, let the dancing begin! Hey, you guys are good. Ahh! I can't take it anymore! They've been at it for hours! Give it a rest, you two! Sorry! A Fishful of Dollars Good morning, class.",
"I trust you've prepared for today's final exam. Excuse me, I've missed a few lectures. Ancient Egyptian algebra. What a nightmare! Mr. Fry, are those your underpants? Young man, it's time you learned a lesson… about Lightspeed-brand briefs. Lightspeed fits an active lifestyle, whether you're working… or having fun. Lightspeed. Style and comfort for the discriminating crotch. Oh! What a weird dream. I'll never get back to sleep. You say they broadcast commercials into people's dreams? Of course.",
"It's very simple. The ad gets into your brain just like this liquid gets into this egg. Although in reality, it's not liquid, but gamma radiation. That's awful! It's like brainwashing. Weren't there ads in your time? Well, sure. But not in our dreams. Only on TV and radio, and in magazines… and movies, and at ball games and on buses… and milk cartons, and bananas and written in the sky. But not in dreams. No, sirree. Quit squawking. Nobody's forcing you to buy anything.",
"We all have commercials in our dreams. We don't run off to buy brand-name merchandise at low, low prices. Care to sample our fragrance from Calvin Clone? No, thanks. And you, sir? No, thanks- We just need to draw attention away from the eye area. Can I try these on? I can't let you open But you can try on the demo pair. Hi, Bender. Great new sweater. New?! What sweater? I came here with it. I don't know you people. $30! I can't afford that. Unless. Do you take Visa? Visa hasn't existed for 500 years.",
"American Express? 600 years. Discover card? Sorry, we don't take Discover. Hey! You buying Lightspeeds? Pretty ritzy. No. I can't afford them. Being poor sucks. They advertise things nobody can afford. Quiet! There's an ad coming on. Hello, shoppers. It's me, Mom. Who's the rocker jockey? It's Mom, the world's most huggable industrialist. When my robots start to squeak like an old screen door… that's when I reach for a can of Mom's Old Fashioned Robot Oil. And remember, Mom's oil is made with 10 % more love.",
"…than the next leading brand. Mom, Iove, and screen door are trademarks of Mom Corp. Sounds like you could use. I'm boned! Freeze, scuzzbot! There's obviously been some sort of a mistake here. I'm sure there's- I say, I'm sure there's- That is, I'm sure there's… a very reasonable. Do we have enough money to pay Bender's fine? Crud! We're 50 cents short. I'd love to chip in, but Bender stole my wallet. That's my old bank! Maybe my account's still open.",
"We don't have your retina scan, fingerprint or colonic map on file. I did open the account over 1 000 years ago. What about my ATM card? Remember your PIN number? It's the price of a pizza and soda where I used to work, Pinucci's Pizza. Okay. You had a balance of 93 cents. All right! And at 2 percent interest over a period of 1 000 years… that comes to 4. 3 billion dollars. To Fry! Cheers! I know Fry's rich, but do we have to wear these hats? Maybe you don't understand just how rich he is.",
"In fact, I think I better put on a monocle. Pizza dinner on me! All right! under 50 million dollars. I haven't got all day. What kind of pizza you guys want? We'll have one with everything but anchovies. And one with my all-time favorite, anchovies. Invalid selection. What are you talking about? You know, those little headless fish. Does not compute. Does not compute. I'm sorry, Fry, but the anchovy has been extinct since the 2200s. About the time your people arrived, wasn't it, Zoidberg? I'm not on trial here.",
"So none of you ever had anchovies? You don't know what you're missing. They're salty and oily, and they melt in your mouth. We kept saying, One more can't hurt, and then they were gone. We're sorry! how great they were. I'm rich, but I can't buy back things I miss from the 20th century. Maybe you're forgetting how rich you are. What do you think? I know you spent a lot of money, but it's awfully primitive. The floors are made of such hard wood. of this pathetic 20th-century TV! What's wrong? Besides causing eye cancer, they had a lousy, low-definition picture.",
"True. On this TV, I bet you couldn't even make out my obscene tattoo. I just don't get it. Who was this Ted Danson? for his skeleton? I have an idea for a sitcom. Leave him alone, Leela. So he's going wacko with his money. It's okay. You're just saying that because he bought you that antique robot toy. Now our final item. This unopened can… of Angry Norwegian-brand anchovies, circa 1997. Anchovies! The last known can in existence, guaranteed fresh and edible. Do I hear $10,000? Are you crazy? It's a can of fish.",
"Don't tell me how to spend my money. 50. Going once, twice- I've never seen her in person before. You can't bid against Mom. She's the richest person in the world. And she's so adorable. Oh, mercy be. A million. Two. Fourteen. I can see the nice young man really wants those little fish. Nevertheless, I'll bid 23 million. One jillion dollars! Sir, that's not a number. In that case, 50 million. Well, boys. Your old mother knows when she's been beat. You win, young man. I tip my bonnet to you.",
"Isn't she sweet? To the gentleman who bought every item in today's auction. Now for some good old Do you remember when cookies… came fresh from the oven? Petridge Farm remembers. Oh, those were the days. Remember when women couldn't vote… and certain folk weren't allowed on golf courses? Petridge Farm remembers. Fry, are you there? You haven't been to work in days. What are you doing? Sitting right here. I picked up my life where I left off 1 000 years ago. You can't just sit here listening to classical music.",
"I could if you hadn't shut off the stereo. This isn't healthy. You're living in the past. I'm rich. I can live whenever I want. But we're your friends, and we live here in the year 3000. Now, are you gonna come. or sit here wallowing in your prehistoric junk? Junk? Maybe you can't understand this… but I finally found what I need to be happy. Things, not friends. I'm a thing. Just leave me alone. Fry, please! My ponytail's caught in the door. I don't need them. I have my antique videos and my bucket of fossilized KFC.",
"50 million dollars worth of anchovies. Mercy me. What a day. Could you shut the door, Edner dear? I think I feel a draft coming on. Holy crap! That bastard's itchy! Walt! Cream soda! Larry, get your mother a cream soda. You heard me. What's wrong, Mommy? It's those damned anchovies! That dirtbag Fry must know their secret. And I won't rest until I get my hands on them. No one messes with Mom. As you know, one of the cornerstones of my empire… is Mom's Old Fashioned Robot Oil.",
"Think of it. Ten billion robots… each one needing an oil change every 3000 miles. You don't have to do the math to know Can I wear your suit? No, Edner! Put that down! with anchovies? I'm getting to the freaking anchovies. One drop of the anchovy's natural oil… would lubricate 1 0 robots permanently. It's a shame they're extinct. No, it isn't! Shut your filthy clam! Thank you, Walt. If anyone ever got hold of anchovy DNA.",
"Cheap, effective robot oil. Enough to put dear old Mom out of business. My God! This Mr. Fry must be a mastermind of the highest order. Esther, you ugly! We have only one option. We'll bankrupt Mr. Fry so he'll have to sell the anchovies to us! Mother, you are one clever old skag. And don't you forget it. Fry's money out of the bank? thanks to the nice people… at Mom's Old Fashioned Video Surveillance Unit. Remember your PIN number? It's the price of a pizza and soda where I used to work, Pinucci's Pizza.",
"It's the price of a pizza and soda- You know what needs to be done. Get his PIN number, you idiots! Now I'm off to some charity B. S. for knocked-up teenage sluts. Mr. Fry, it's those three plumbers you called for. We're here to tighten your drains. I didn't order any- Quick! Give him the tranquilizer! Wake up, Mr. Fry. Where am l? You're in the good old year 2000, working at Pinucci's Pizza. You fell asleep on the job. That sounds like me. But I thought I got frozen. Wasn't I in the future? No.",
"You only dreamed you were in the year 3000. So I'm really back? That's exactly what I wanted, I guess. Who are you? I'm Mr. Pinucci. You are? Did you grow a mustache since last night? No! Go work the currency register. I think I hear a customer coming. I said, I think I hear a customer coming! Oh, hurry. I want to get Don't worry. This won't take long. Your motivation is you're back in 2000 and your head's still on your body… and you want a cheese pizza. I'm only doing this so people will take my head seriously as an actress.",
"Hey, look. Anchovies. Of course. They're not extinct yet. And if you need more proof that this is really 1 000 years ago… well, here's contemporary actress, Pamela Anderson. Hello, Fry. Remember me from It was the first movie to be shot entirely in slow motion! It hasn't been made yet. Then he doesn't know I won the Oscar? Wait! You're Pamela Anderson! Cool! What can I get you? and a large. Line! Oh, right! Cheese pizza and a large soda. Cheese and a $10.77, same as my PIN number.",
"Hey, you don't get to laugh. Thanks a billion! More like 4.3 billion. I had a nightmare. I was in the year I'm so glad I'm awake now and you're here. So you care about us? You only care about anchovies and stuffy old songs about buttocks. No, that's not true! This dream brought to you Bender! Leela! Don't leave me! Wait a minute. Buddy, what year is this? Life is wonderful! What are you doing Check bounced. We're taking it all back. Oh, no. My ATM card! My secret PIN number, 1077.",
"I've got nothing left. You're Fry's relative. Do you know how he got so crazy? They say madness runs in our family. Some even call me mad. And why? Because I dared to dream of my own race of atomic monsters! Atomic supermen with octagonal-shaped bodies. Leela! Bender! I missed you so much. You did? What happened? I was robbed. They got everything except these. Hello, Fry. I felt terrible when I heard about your money troubles. young man by buying his anchovies. Sorry, but they aren't for sale.",

"Bam! Hey, what you watching? Nothing. Is that a cooking show? No, of course not. It was porno. Yeah, that's it! I didn't know you liked cooking. It's true. I've been hiding it for so long.

I do have trouble breathing underwater You don't need lungs anymore. Can't imagine why I would. I take lungs now. Gills come next week. Nurse! You may feel small pain. Thank you. What were you doing? I said to stay away from them. Did you ever stop to think I might be happier with gills? Good news. I don't like the sound of that! You'll be making a delivery to the planet Trisol.",

"Hello. Anybody home? The royal bottle is empty. You drank our emperor. No! It wasn't me! You drank our emperor. You assassinated him. He looked so cool and refreshing. I am sure he was. But now he's gone and your fate is sealed. All hail the new emperor. After I specifically asked you not to touch anything… you drank strange blue liquid? It could've been poisonous. Chances were equally good it was an emperor. I am Merg, the high priest. If I might interject?",
"You choose a prime minister. I suggest Gorgak, the previous appointee. I will be a forceful administrator. of becoming a prime minister. I gotta go with Bender. In your face, Gorgak. That's it. As your captain, I order you back to the ship. Gee, I better check with my prime minister. Stay the course, pal. A package came for you. Hey, thanks. This got here just in time. This is your harem. You may choose any of these maidens to be your consort. How about that one? I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.",
"On second thought, I'll take that one. I'm not here to pass judgment. Does anyone else think it's odd that a 25-year-old delivery boy… could kill the emperor and be rewarded, not punished? Don't beat around the bush. We know who you mean. Me, right? Don't worry. These people seem really mild-mannered. They are mild. You're soaking in one right now.

Eighty thousand years? No, one week. I knew you wouldn't ask unless it was really high or low. Every emperor ascended to power by assassinating the previous one. And guess who's next? My assassin will get his. You're in tremendous danger! Half of them were drunk at their coronation. I plan on having a few brewskis myself.",
"No, they were assassinated. if you fail to recite the oath. I'll thumb through that later. That's so reckless. Don't you ever think ahead? If I did, I wouldn't be emperor. I wouldn't be here in 3000. Like the story of the grasshopper and octopus. All year the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter. The winter came and the grasshopper died.

Check out the glowing freaks. The emperor Bont! He's still alive. Of course I'm alive. Cut this creep open and drain me out. My tummy hurts. They're running up the stairs! Let us in! Fry must die so that Bont may live. We gotta get the emperor out before they kill you. I'll spin you in a high-speed centrifuge.",
"Won't that crush my bones? The bones. I always forget about the bones. I refuse to be dripped out through somebody's armpit. I can vomit or urinate. How's that? My favorite so far is the bone-crushing. What about crying? That's a great idea! That or the bone one. Keep it up, men. The veneer is starting to peel. Oh, dear. I want to cry, I'll make you cry, buddy. You're a pimple on society's ass! You'll never amount to anything! I was emperor of a planet.",
"True. Here's a disturbing reminderEveryone you knew or loved in the 20th century is dead. These things happen. Grab a Kleenex for this oneThere is no God, and your human ideals are laughable! Phew! That's a load off my mind. Man, I guess it's harder than I thought to make someone cry. You did your best. Up yours, bimbo. We're in hot butter. We should call Leela for help. Cram it, lobster!

They have her totally outnumbered! She's risking her life for me after the way I treated her? I don't deserve this.",
"I feel terrible. Is she all right? I don't know. Perhaps I'll look out this window. Dear God! They're swarming all over. What are you talking about? She's- They are strapping her to the juicer. They're putting some ice cubes in that glass under it. This can't be happening. It can. And for all you know, it is. I'm sorry, Fry. She's dead. All she ever wanted to do was help me. And I was too proud and stupid I wish I had died instead of her. What are you talking about? You're alive! Of course I am.",
"I said you were dead so he'd cry out the emperor. You wrecked it by surviving. We only got two drops. It's only a matter of time. I'll handle this. I think I can get us out of this if you're willing to let me help. Thanks, Leela. I know you want what's best for me. What's that for? Come on! That hurt. I know. Now I understand. Come on, everybody help Fry. Thanks, everybody. I love you all. You guys are true- Cut it out, Bender. That's a tender area. How we doing, Amy? We're 1 /1 0 of the way there.",

The scientific event of the season. Every member presents an invention. The best one wins the Academy prize. Sounds boring. Oh, my, yes.",
"But not this year… because my latest invention is unbeatable. Jam your finger in the hole. This readout… tells you how long Does it really work? Sometimes it's off by seconds.

These youngsters look up to me. Look who's showing his wrinkled face. Just leave me alone, Wernstrom.",
"You're over the hill, Farnsworth. Leave science to the 120-year-olds. You think you know everything. I invented things when you were barely turning senile. Go home before you embarrass yourself, old man. Now excuse me. I'm taking a nap before the ceremonies. Who's that jerk? He was my most promising student But then, after one A-minus? No one gives Ogden Wernstrom an A-minus! I'm sorry, but penmanship counts. I swear I'll have my revenge if it takes me 1 00 years. And here it is, slightly over I'm essentially in the clear.",
"I've been perusing your fortified wine list… and I've selected the'57 Chateau Par-Tay, and the'66 Thunder Chevitz. Exquisite choices, sir. And mix them all together in a big jug. Welcome to this year's symposium. I'm your host, Ron Popeil… inventor of Mr. Microphone, the Spray-on Toupee… and the technology to keep heads alive in jars. Wait, there's more. We've got many inventors tonight… starting with that up-and-coming young star, Ogden Wernstrom.",
"More wine! Distinguished members of the Academy, I present the Reverse Scuba Suit. Observe. Don't worry. It's no competition for your Death Clock. What will you be presenting, grandpa? It'll put you young whippersnappers in your place. I hope it's not as lame as last year's Death Clock. Last year? That's right. Did it put you youngsters in place? Hardly. We laughed until our teeth fell out. Come along, Cinnamon. I have to invent something new in the next 1 0 minutes. Perhaps some sort of Death Clock! Uh, professor? Very nice.",
"Amazing! Our last presentation comes from our oldest member, Hubert Farnsworth. Professor? Just a second. Just a second. Pencils down, prune-face. Here I am. Now, hello there. We all know telescopes allow us to see distant objects… but what if we want to smell those objects? Well, now we can. Thanks to my new invention. The odor travels past this coffee stain here. Around the olive pit… and into this cigar burn. And this appears to be a. But the Smell-O-Scope is brilliant! Think of the astronomical odors you'll smell, thanks to me! I've waited 1 00 years for this.",
"I give your invention the worst grade imaginableAn A-minus-minus! Now for the presentation of the award. I'm practically giving this away to… Dr. Wernstrom, for his fish thingy. Perhaps 1 49 is just too old to be a scientist. No, professor! Don't give up! There were many times in my century when I never gave up. Never. Are you even listening to me? By God, you're right! I'm going to build that Smell-O-Scope! Eureka! No, I remembered that I built one last year! Go ahead, try it.",
"You'll find that every heavenly body has its own scent. Here, I'll point it at Jupiter. Smells like strawberries. And now, Saturn. Pine needles. Man, this is great! As long as you don't make me smell Uranus. I don't get it. I'm sorry, Fry. Astronomers renamed Uranus in 2620 to end that stupid joke once and for all. What's it called now? Urectum. Here, let me locate it for you. No, I think I'll just smell around over here. Oh, jeez! Oh, man! Remarkable! A stench so foul it's right off the funkometer! Fry may have discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Oh! Name it after me! I think it's moving.",

This thing will destroy The answer lies in this movie I found on the Internet. New York City. The year 2000. in history… was running out of places to bury its never-ending output of garbage. The landfills were full. New Jersey was full. Under cover of darkness, the city put its garbage out to sea.",

Finally, in 2052, the city used its mob connections to obtain a rocket… and launch the garbage into outer space. Some experts claim the ball may return to Earth. But their concerns were dismissed as depressing. You got that off the Internet? In my day it was only used to download porn.",

"Morbo agrees. Can't we shoot a missile at it? The supercomputer's simulation. Missiles would go through it. But suppose we sent a crew to plant an explosive on the fault line… between this mass of coffee grounds and this deposit of AOL floppy disks? In theory, it could work. But you'll never find a crew willing to go on such a suicidal mission. Oh, crap! You only have one chance to destroy the ball. After that, it'll be so close that blowing it up.",

Well, with Zapp gone and my parents still here… I suggest Fry give me a nice, convincing kiss. Now there's something we can all enjoy.",
"Sir, remember your course correction? It's proving more suicidal than we'd hoped. I don't know which disgusts me more, your cowardice or stupidity. We'll set a new course for that region… near that black-ish hole-ish thing. Why'd you run off from dinner? I didn't run off. I had time to finish eating while you were kissing Amy. I'm not interested in her, if that's bothering you. Are you sure? I mean, We seem like a perfect match. But I don't feel that way about her. Nice nebula.",

Without his hat, he might be no more intelligent than you. I hate that rodent! He's my most important experiment. If you don't stop fighting, I'll have you both neutered.

"I was off at a study session with Chrissy. in honor of Parents' Weekend… I have a special surprise for you. Mom! Dad! What are you doing here? This is so humiliating! Now these monkeys I like! What's that? You want to come out? What's that they're flinging at us? Dear Lord! All over the dean! Why don't join your parents on the chandelier? I'll take a picture! The party's winding down. Let's take a road trip to Tijuana and get Fat-Bot some action! It's my first time. I'm really nervous.",
"You were cruel. It may sound like an after-school special… but we learned who the real animal was today. Peer pressure? Look out! He's got a gun! Leave me alone. What's going on? I thought you don't like bananas. Of course I do. I try so hard to fit in… but seeing my parents. made me realize I'm just a primitive beast. Not everyone turns out like their parents. Look at me. My folks were honest, hardworking people. Besides, you're not like other monkeys. You've got the hat.",
"So what? I mean, sure, it looks cool, and it makes me smart. But it doesn't make me happy. That's so sad. I didn't even know monkeys could cry. They can't. It's all the hat! If you're so miserable, maybe you should go back to the jungle. The jungle. I couldn't do that to the professor. I'm his prize experiment. He's like a father. He's not your father. That guy in the punch bowl was your father. Look at him. I'm so proud. Thanks, professor. Oh, I always feared he might run off like this.",
"Why didn't I break his legs? Oh, poor Guenter. So he just ran away in I'm afraid so. All he handed in was a paper smeared with feces. He tied with Fry. I told him to go back to the jungle. You what? After I spent months slaving over a hot monkey brain? You tried to force Guenter to be a human, but he's an animal. He belongs in the wild, or the circus on a tiny tricycle. Now that's entertainment. But Guenter's better off being intelligent. Tell him, Leela. I'm staying out of this. Now here's my opinion.",
"We'll go to the jungle… and let Guenter decide. You all know the rules. The winning house becomes Greek Council head. Should that house currently be on any type of multiple secret probation. And I'll be forced to serve as Grand Marshal of a parade honoring them. Your watercraft's as ill-designed as you yourselves. Good one, Chet. Well, I never! Fraternities, on your marks. The jungles on Mars look like the jungles on earth. Jungles on earth? I see some movement. I think it's him.",
"Stand back! Don't worry. They'll be fine once the tranquilizer wears off. There's our man. Professor, offer Guenter the hat. Fry, offer him the banana. He'll choose if he wants to be intelligent or a mindless animal. Guenter, take the hat. No, the banana! The banana! The philosophical and metaphysical ramifications- Banana! Banana! What's that sound? You sure this is a shortcut? Not as sure as I was an hour ago. And the winner is. Thank God this log is sturdy. Put on the hat! You're the only one who can save us! Stupid monkey.",
"Not there! Keep trying! Eureka! The hat goes on the head! It's all so obvious now! Help us, Guenter! My goodness! Hang on! I need to do some calculations! Grab on! We're saved! Appreciate it, Guenter! Oh, no! Hurry, Guenter! Climb up the vine! You can still save yourself. Why bother? I've got nothing to live for. I was miserable as a genius. As a monkey, I was so dumb I tried to wear a hat on my butt. There's just no place for me in this world. Although, on the other hand… Oh, that poor, sweet monkey.",
"Let's go gather him up. No sense letting him go to waste. Guenter, you're alive! I guess the hat broke my fall. It's working at half capacity. But I can fix it. I actually feel sort of. But what about your super-intelligence? With that, there was too much pressure. I want to be a moderately intelligent monkey who wears a suit. So I'm transferring to business school!

Professor! Steady, now. There we go. Now I'll simply tune it to Leela's emotional frequency.",
"My God, I'm overcome with feelings. I'm experiencing a powerful yearning… to cram my gullet with mackerel heads. I feel I'm not as smart as Leela… but I also feel relieved that I'm cuter than her. Thanks for covering. Now I miss Nibbler, and I feel nosy and opinionated. Bingo! It's her! Thanks. I'm happy Bender can finally feel my pain. Happy. I like this feeling. Don't revert to your usual mopey self. I'm not mopey. You shut up! Anger, huh? How dare you make me feel anger.",
"Thanks for taking me out. I'm now slightly less miserable. You know what'd cheer you up? Getting a puppy! Nibbler loved to eat puppies. What's your problem? I miss Nibbler. Hell, no!

They're hideous! Mutants are just a ridiculous urban myth. Don't be so sure. Many scientists believe humans could mutate down there.",
"God bless America. Ladies first. Oh, and the aftertaste. I burned my finger! We're under Park Avenue. Ritzy! Just think. All this was probably once a charity luncheon for the Met. Why did I throw out the manual? You didn't have to come down here. I know, but I just missed Nibbler so much. This emotional display is making me nauseous. Or maybe it's from that. Nibbler! It's no use. We'd better turn back.",
"Which way, Fry? According to this map, the only exit is through that pipe. It gets wider after a mile. Okay, never mind. for directions. Mutants! Mutants! They're real! I'll take care of this! Thanks, handsome. Don't worry, we're harmless. I have three arms! I said, harmless not armless! Lay off him. He only has one ear. Shouldn't you eat my brain? You're mutants! Mutants? Perhaps you are the mutants. Dwayne, have you looked in a mirror lately? Welcome to our village. It's not Paris.",
"You do realize you live in a sewer. Perhaps your civilization… is the sewer of an even greater No, we're on top. Daylight and everything. It must be wonderful! We came down here to find our pet. He was flushed down the toilet he probably came through here. Everything always does. Follow me. All that is ours came from your toilets. Over there is our aquarium. This is our library. Just crumpled porn and Ayn Rand.",
"Over here is our church. You guys worship an unexploded nuclear bomb? Nobody's that observant. It's mainly for Christmas and Easter. Nibbler! Do alligators flushed down toilets live here? That's an urban legend. Then what are those? Crocodiles. They're our pets. When they grow too large, we flush them into the sub-sewer. There's a race of sub-mutants there. a sub-urban legend. Then I suppose you also don't believe in El Chupakneebray. El Chupakneebray? What's that? Gather around for the legend of El Chupakneebray.",
"He creeps in the midnight hush Silent as a loW-floW toilet flush But sooner or later And half your alligator Crocodile. Whatever. Our pet, Nibbler, loves fresh crocodile. It's his favorite treat. He must be El Chupakneebray. You unleashed El Chupakneebray upon us? Then you are our sworn enemies! He would never hurt people. Let us help you capture him. Impossible. If legend's true, our only hope is to give a snack-rifice! Yes, an unspoiled virgin. I volunteer! Nice try, Leela…",
"But we've all seen Zapp Brannigan's web page. Chain her to the post! And rip her shirt a little. Behold! When El Chupakneebray comes for the, uh, virginhe will be snared by this rope trap. El Chupakneebray comes soon. It is nightfall. Nightfall? How can you tell down here? The tide is coming in. Quiet. The beast approaches. Nibbler! Come here, precious. Look, everyone. It's El Chupakneebray. That's not him. That's El Chupakneebray! I'll take care of this! Do something! I'm too scared! Your fear is being transmitted to Bender! If you care about Nibbler, stop caring! I can't! I love all creatures! Even me? As a friend.",
"Damn. Listen to me. I'm an expert at not caring. The secret is not giving a rat's ass about anyone… and only caring about things that you want… that you deserve, that the world owes you! Well, I could use a new tank top. Bigger! Bigger! A fashionable tank top! And designer boots encrusted with jewels! You'll need some pants And I could afford it all if I didn't have to feed that stupid Nibbler! Bender is back! I'll save you, Nibbler! Know what else I could use? A weekend at a fancy spa.",
"And a Toblerone. Let's have a tissue-tape parade! No, thanks. Gather around to hear the legend of Bender. He came from above With a. It'll be ages before another guitar string is flushed. That's a disgusting story. All thanks to Bender. I love you, Bender. before I kill myself. You won't believe this, but the empathy chip burned out. The emotion you felt for Nibbler was your own! So Bender learned a lesson… about respecting other people's feelings after all. No, I'm wrong.",
"The chip was running at triple capacity. And I still barely felt anything. Good night, losers! Maybe Bender didn't learn from me… but I learned something from him. So long, jerkwads! So long! Horsy to Pointy Guy Six. Brannigan Begins Again Good news. We have a mission to further intergalactic peace. Nope. Watching cartoons. Sorry. What's the mission? A delivery for the Democratic Order of Planets. It's like the United Nations from your time, Fry. Or like the Federation from Star Trek.",
"Tonight's the ribbon cutting for DOOP's new base. What are we delivering? Something necessary to the ceremony. The oversized scissors. We'll deliver them as fast as we can. Okay. But don't run with them! Wow, a million aliens. I've never seen anything so mind-blowing! A reception table with muffins! Ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the ribbon cutting for the DOOP's new headquarters. A fitting home for an organization that fosters peace everywhere. Even between the Insectoids and the Space Lizards.",
"What's it like on Amazonia? Big rats there. Me crush with club. That's so interesting. Why don't we have coffee together? There's no better place for a home of diplomacy… than here orbiting the Neutral Planet. What are your thoughts, Your Neutralness? I have no strong feelings one way or the other. I hate these filthy Neutrals. You know where enemies stand. But with Neutrals, who knows? It sickens me. He means you guys did it. We brought scissors for the ceremony. Then you're under arrest.",
"How do I know these aren't part of a Neutral plot? They're not sharp. Who could I hurt? The Yarn People of Nylar Four. So a plan to assassinate a weird-looking alien with scissors. How very Neutral of you. It was almost the perfect crime. But you forgot one thingRock crushes scissors. But paper covers rock. And scissors cuts paper. Kif, we have a conundrum. Search them for paper. And bring me a rock. So beautiful, yet so Neutral. Drag them to the ship! To cut the ribbon, the legendary DOOP captain.",
"Zapp Brannigan. What makes a man turn Neutral? Lust for gold? Power? Or were you born with a heart of Neutrality? Sir? You should be cutting the ribbon now. No matter. I'll simply cut it from here with the ship's laser. That may not be wise. Kif, I don't need your that-may-not-be-wise attitude. You are accused of blowing up DOOP headquarters. How do you plead? Absolutely 99 percent not guilty. The prosecutor will call a witness.",
"Your Honor, I'm a simple hyper-chicken from a backwoods asteroid… but if it please the court, I'll call the entire jury. Members of the jury… did you all happen to gander… at who blew up that there DOOP headquarters? That's the guy there. Are you gonna vote to convict him? You better believe it. The jury will disregard its testimony. Your Honor, the prosecution rests. The evidence against Brannigan is strong. But, in light of his service, and this incompetent prosecutor.",
"I'm afraid I must dismiss all charges. What? Your Honor, I know the case is closed and you've given a verdict… but I want to testify. Miss Leela, on the date in question… were you or weren't you wearing a skirt? That's a dumb question. What matters is Zapp's the worst captain ever. I saw him blow up DOOP headquarters with my own eye. I'd like to cross-examine. We've met before, have we not? On that occasion, you had sex with someone? May I remind you, you're under oath.",
"Please point out the person And his name is? Zapp Brannigan. The same man who didn't blow up DOOP headquarters. I rest my case. Jury members, you may begin your deliberations. Your Honor, we have reached a verdict. We find the defendant guilty. You are hereby stripped of your rank… and dismissed from the DOOP. I'd like to make one final statement. Kif, come and hold up the flag. Wave it a little, for God's sake. You can take away a man's title and his uniform. But you can't take away his integrity and honor.",
"You too are stripped of your rank… and dishonorably discharged. One day a man has everything. Then he blows up a $400 billion space station. Next he has nothing. Makes you think. No, it doesn't. It's time to begin our life as civilians. That's an order, soldier! Hey, Bender? This is the third hose fight I've broken up. And the second one with real hoses. Move your asses and scrub the ship like I ordered! You don't have to get so mad. Fry wiped off some of the dirt. I didn't know where else to turn.",
"You're the only one who loved me. I never loved you. Let me work for food. I'll paint, or service you sexually, or mop up. You can't do any of those things. Who are you talking to? Just a hobo who's hit rock bottom… and his commander. You're that disgraced captain. He'll distract people from our awful safety record. Come in! I want everyone to meet our new employees. Which ones are new? The green dude and the fat man. I haven't seen that robot before. I'm Bender. You know, the lovable rascal.",
"Oh, yes. My good friend, of course. Whoever you all are, I have good news. You have a delivery to Stumbos Four. The gravity is so high… you might be crushed by your own hair. Enjoy! I know she's a very sensuous woman. How is she as a captain? Really strict. And mean. Does she spank the crew? No, she just makes us work. Good. But should she ever institute some sort of spanking policy… I'll go for you. I won't have my comrades harmed. Hey, this guy's all right! Here's to us poor schmoes working for the man.",
"Even if he is a hot, sexy, female man. I computed our landing coordinates. Thanks. Very nice work. I said, Very nice work. Okay, crew. You have to deliver Not heavy, but I'm still complaining. an anti-grav pump. Once you're out there, gravity will be very intense. Hey, no prob. This lead apron will protect me. No screw-ups. Use the hover dolly and deliver one pillow at a time. Let's deliver them all at once! That's using your noodle. Come on, girdle. Hold. What the hell happened? Some breaking, involving the dolly.",
"That's all we know. not to overload it. Each pillow weighs 150 Ibs. here. Don't get your panties in a knot. No way. You disobeyed an order… so now you have to hand-deliver I have a serious question. Does the company that made your bra do girdles? I ask because a friend. Just get to work! I'm Leela. Get to work. I agree. The point is, it's just so humiliating working for him. Once he actually ordered me to… shave his armpits while he was in the tub. So I.",
"Why don't we talk about something besides Zapp? Oh, all right. Okay, well, there he was in the tub, right? Some good old high-gravity rain. we'd have broken it and given up. A good captain needs many skills… like boldness, daring, and a velour uniform. I'm not convinced she has any of those. Leela's not too bad. She just makes us work so much. When I was captain, I only wanted my men's loyalty. I didn't care if they… drank beer in their underwear. Beer? Underwear? But now, Zapp's not captain anymore.",
"I'm free! Hear that? I'm actually laughing. This is a mutiny! You're out of here, lady. Zapp's the new captain. All hail the new captain! You're a capable doer of the nasty… but I'm taking over. On what grounds, you oaf? Failure to prevent a mutiny. Throw her in the brig. What brig? Then the laundry room… which will hereafter be called the brig. You don't want me as captain? Right, genius. Didn't I do well? You were mean. You yelled. You made us work. A captain needs to do that.",
"I thought we were friends… you shouldn't have been so mean. Don't worry. Soon we'll be able to look back on this and laugh. Back in uniform. It nearly. despite the fattening hobo diet. Put them in the laundry brig. Do I have your loyalty? To the ends of the universe. Ten hundred percent. That's not enough. You're to sit and drink until you're as loyal as Kif. Yes, sir, sir! May I have a beer, sir? No. You're loyal enough. Meanwhile, I have a plan. We'll attack our archenemy, the Neutral Planet.",
"Once the threat is gone… I'll be a hero and the DOOP will reinstate me. Sir, that plan makes no sense. Maybe not to you. But you were court-martialed in disgrace. Burn! Prepare for the fight between good and Neutral. And they'll be like… and we'll have pancakes to celebrate. And I'll be like. Precisely. Now, in the name of all that is honorable. of peace, then fire. Yes, sir. Fly the white flag of war. This is Zapp Brannigan, of the ship. Planet Express Ship.",
"I come in peace. Can we trust him, Your Neutralness? All I know is my gut says maybe. What now? We crash into the headquarters… killing them in a firestorm from which nothing can escape. And then? Then your mission is complete. I'll already have ejected wearing the only space suit. Wait. Is this gonna kill us? Yes. That's what I meant by loyalty. Now help me into the only suit. You may need baby powder. We want you back as captain. Let me guess. He canceled naptime? He ran out of beer? We want Leela to be captain.",
"Mutiny? Never thought I'd see the day. There's a child's suit for you. I want to stay here with Leela. She actually listens He's disabled the steering! We're gonna crash! Leela, save me! And yourself, I guess. And my banjo! And Fry. Okay. We have one chance. Even if I make you work? As your God is my witness. Get the backup dolly and put all dark matter into the left engine. Aw, man! That crap's heavy! And warm. Your Neutralness, beige alert. I don't want to die at age 25. Unless We hit a time Warp, don't Worry about it.",
"And no one will be punished for the mutiny! When Leela panicked, maybe because of female troubles… my quick mind saved the day. Is this tale of magic and glory true? Good. If they don't take him It's true. My female incompetence, his cat-like reflexes… the stuff that made no sense, In that case, Zapp Brannigan… I hereby restore your rank and parking privileges. Come, Kif. We've got work to do. I'll call and tell you about it. Leela, even though you're mean.",
"You're the best captain ever. Yeah. You're one dynamite lady. Can we have a week off? Come on, captain. Oh, all right. Oh, man. Let's mutiny. A Head in the Polls You're entering the vicinity of an area adjacent to a location. A place you might find a monster or Weird mirror. These are examples. It could be much better. Prepare to enter The Scary Door. Per your request, please find enclosed the last man on earth. Finally, solitude. I can read books for all eternity. It's not fair.",
"It's not fair! Wait, my eyes aren't that bad. I can read the large print books. It's not. ! Well, lucky I can read braille. Hey, look, a weird mirror. Cursed by his own hubris. A debate's on! Change the channel! That's what Fry said when we turned on the debate. CSpan 9 presents The Thrill of Politics. There are no car chases… but one of these men will become president of the world. So? We live in the United States. That's part of the world. I have been gone a long time.",
"It's time someone had the courage to sayI'm against things everybody hates. I respect my opponent. He's a good man. But frankly, I agree with everything These candidates sound like clones. Wait, they are clones! Even with identical DNA, they differ on key issues. Your three-cent titanium tax goes too far! Your three-cent titanium tax doesn't go too far enough! If I were registered, I'd send a message… by staying home on election day, dressed like a clown. You're not registered? Not vaccinated, either.",
"One vote never made a difference. The first robot president won by exactly one vote. John Quincy Adding Machine. He enticed voters by pledging not to go on a killing spree. But, like most, he promised more than he could deliver. One vote can make a difference… and even though it won't, you're going to register. Let's all go register. When did you care about voting? The very instant I became old. The problem is, both parties give your tax dollars… to the less fortunate.",
"They get all the breaks! You could join a third party, maybe. Only weirdos and mutants join third parties. I'd better keep an eye out at the next meeting. What's your party, Bender? I can't vote. Because you're a robot? No, a felon. We favor huge subsidies to the Brain Slug planet. Okay, but what are the Brain Slugs gonna do for the working man? Attach Brain Slugs to them. Sure, you say that now. Is it true you can make shirts and rope out of hemp? Dave's not here, man. I heard hemp makes great shampoo.",
"I gotta check out this brochure. What are you doing to protect my right to bear doomsday devices? We'll get rid of the three-day waiting period for mad scientists. Today, the mad scientist can't get. tomorrow, the mad grad student. Where will it end? Amen! I don't go anywhere without my mutated anthrax… for duck hunting. Sure, humans are cute. I concur. Here's a party to get excited about. Sign me up. Okay, screw it. Welcome aboard, brother! All right! You're out.",
"I'm actually getting interested in politics. the question is. the next president of Earth? Jack Johnson, or bitter rival, John Jackson? Terrific candidates, huh, Morbo?

Without a quick response, the robots Will die Within 300 years. What rescue operations are planned? We'll pave over the area, then move on. The neWs sent titanium prices skyrocketing.",
"I'm rich! What do you mean? My body's 40 percent titanium. I'm finally richer than those snooty ATMs. Too bad you can't spend it. Oh, can't I? Watch me, poor man. Pleasure doing business with you. Game's over, losers. I have all the money. Compare your lives to mine, and then kill yourselves. You get five dollars to not do what you're thinking about. You just lost five dollars. Thank you! Hello, peasants. What happened to you? Yeah, did you get a haircut? Sold your body? Bender, I've been down that road.",
"It's glamorous, the parties are great… but you'll spend every dollar on jewelry and skintight pants. How are you gonna live without a body? Bodies are for hookers and fat people. All I need is a wad of Now you can pay off your loan shark. What's he gonna do, break my legs? Another martini, please? Shaken, not stirred. Put it all on black. I beg your pardon, 33 black.

"Oh, I'm sorry, that's just your body. Look me in the shins and say that! I've had it up to here I'm off to hang out with classy heads like me, who appreciate… poetry, philosophy, hats. So long, coffin stuffers! Could one of you coffin stuffers please carry me? Which group of heads is good enough for me? What do you think, Fry? Hi, I'm Claudia Schiffer's head. I recognize you. Didn't you have a body? Yeah, but it was holding me back. I just did the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swim Cap Issue.",

Legally, nothing I can do counts as sex anymore. around meaty-looking women. I remember you. I was gonna vote for you. But voting isn't cool, so I got trashed on Listerine. I've never felt voting is essential to the process. No kidding, Ford. So the hooker-bot says, That's not my expansion slot… and my friend says, That's not my 25-pin connector!

"He doesn't care about your ding-dong. Even if you miss your body, being a head's great too? No, son. It's a sad and lonely life. Great! Kick them when they're down. Ones, zeros… one, one, zero, zero, one. Bender, what is it? What an awful dream. Ones and zeros everywhere! And I thought I saw a two. It was just a dream. There are no twos. I know what's wrong. My body loved me, and I turned its back on it. Well, old friend, tie a yellow ribbon round your neck. I'm coming home! I can't reveal that.",
"But I'll give you $50 for the kid. My clothes are worth 50 bucks. How could I let this happen? I can't go through life like this! What about your self-destruct button? It's on my body! What am I gonna do? I can't stand to see a robot cry. And so, ladies and gentlemen, I'm throwing my head into the ring. I'm announcing my candidacy for the Presidency of Earth! Sir, the Constitution states… nobody can be elected president more than twice. That's right, no body. But, as you can plainly see, I've got a shiny new body.",
"Bender, he's got your body! That double-crossing bastard! How dare he run off with Nixon! He must have bought your body. And that electric guitar. I'm meeting you halfway, I am not a crook's head. Yeah, you are! Fry, Leela, you gotta help me. Ordinarily I'd say no, and how it's your fault for being an idiot. But when a robotic Nixon is loose, we have to take action! Morbo will introduce the candidates. Puny human number one. Puny human number two. And my good friend, Richard Nixon. Hello, Morbo.",
"Belligerent and numerous. Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. First he steals my body, now he's touching my stuff. We've got to find a way Morbo demands an answer to the following questionIf you saw candy in the hands. would you seize and eat it? Unthinkable! Wouldn't think it! What about you, Mr. Nixon? You are under a truth-o-scope. The question is vague. You don't say what kind of candy, whether anyone is watching. I certainly wouldn't harm the child. You scored big points.",
"They ate me alive out there. But your body's message was, Look at my shiny new body. You've got real charisma from the neck down. Nixon with charisma? My God, I can rule the universe! Look here, you drugged-out communist. I paid for this body… and I'd no sooner return it than I would my dog. Please, we're appealing to your sense of decency. Seriously, I'm never giving back Beat it! Or I'll get Cambodian on your asses! It's hopeless. We might as well turn in my head for the five-cent deposit.",
"My best friend's not getting recycled! Not for five cents, not for 500 cents. I have a plan. I have a better plan. Why would Nixon stay here? You get a discount if you've been here before. Keep going. We're right behind you. Get a room, you two! We're in a room! Then lose some weight! Oh, yeah. You women's libbers really know how to party. There I am. Hey, Betty Friedan, send a little of that lotion my way. Don't panic. You shaggy peaceniks have some nerve. I want what's mine! Don't make me kick your neck.",
"Bring it on, soup can. Break it up, you two! You're going to jail! And I don't grant pardons like that sissy, Ford. You won't pardon anyone, because you won't get elected. The voters aren't pea-brained idiots anymore. No? Listen here, missy. Computers may be twice as fast as they were in 1973… but voters are as drunk and stupid as ever! The only one who's changed is me. I've become bitter and crazy. Once I'm in office, I'll sell our children's organs to zoos for meat! I'll go into people's houses at night and wreck up the place! One vote won't make a difference.",
"Excuse me, while I inch myself over to the phone and call the police. Not so fast, Nixon! Are you familiar with audio tape? I don't like where this is heading. I'll go into people's houses at night and Wreck up the place! I really sound like that? I thought I had a Clark Gable quality. We'll trade you the tape for the body.

Let me ax you something. Would it cheer you up if we go get an Xmas tree? Yeah! An old-fashioned Xmas tree.",
"These aren't Xmas trees! They're like a pine tree. Pine trees have been extinct for 800 years, Fry. Gone the way of the poodle and your primitive notions of modesty. Ah! Brisk. This isn't the way Christmas There, there. Everything's changed. That's not true. Oh Xmas tree Oh Xmas tree Every Christmas, Mom would get a goose for goose burgers. Dad would whip up his special eggnog out of bourbon and ice cubes. This dumb holiday just makes me think of all I left behind. Let's just stop talking about Xmas.",

"Yes. And the only one of her species in all the known universe. What a lonely life. My God, poor Leela. Heard you needed cheering up. Well, old Bender will make you laugh. Man. I got to work on my act. I feel like a rat. I've been whining like a pig while Leela was lonely as a frog. I'll do it for you. Thanks. You should be ashamed of yourself.

Which costs more, the parrot or the lizard? The lizards are a buck each. The parrot is $500. That's a hell of a good parrot. Although, I could get 500 lizards for the same price.",
"Girls like swarms of lizards, right? Sir, the store is closing in 2 minutes. Okay. I'll take the 500 lizards. The parrot! I spent every penny I had, but I bet Leela's going to love you. You're quite the talker, aren't you? Stupid bird! I know where you live! Sorry I stormed out before. I didn't mean to ruin everyone's Xmas. You were gone? I get tired of Fry always only thinking of himself. I hear that. I ax him to set the table. And he goes out to buy you a present. Selfish dog. His life's in danger! I'm telling you why.",
"Santa Claus is coming to town! All right, bird. You thought you'd beat me in a game of wits, but you just met your equal. Cornered! Hi, there. I am going to get you so many lizards. You didn't need to buy me a present. I just wanted to make you happy. but you never even had a family. You're lonely, and I'm lonely. But together, we're lonely together. Merry Xmas, Leela. Merry Xmas. Oh, boy! It's Santa! You've been very naughty, Fry and Leela. I checked my list. I perform over 50 mega-checks per second.",
"You're both naughty for disregarding each other's feelings. But we set things right. Fry even risked his life to get me a present. But what about your other co-workers? Did either of you ever stop to think about Doctor Zoidberg's feelings? No, I swear! Santa has something very special in his sack for you. So lock the door and hit the floor Because Santa Claus comes tonight Whoa. Hold on. What about the traditional glass of hard cider? Oh, all right. But just one glass. Okay, that's enough.",
"I said, that's enough! Get her purse! cookies for you! You dare bribe Santa? I'll shove coal so far up your stocking, you'll cough up diamonds! We're trapped. I never thought it'd end this way, gunned down by Santa Claus. Honestly, I didn't see it coming. Goodbye, Fry. Hey, look. We're under the mistletoe. Your mistletoe is no match for my T. O. W. missile. Your present may need some assembly. On the fourth day of Xmas I stole from that lady Four family photos Three jars of pennies TWo former husbands And a slipper on a shoe tree Oh, thank you! It's humans! Shall we mug them, robot, sir? No, wait.",
"I know these guys. They got nothing! You've been very naughty, Bender! I didn't do nothing. You're thinking of the kid. My God, Bender. Framing an orphan? That's so naughty I'll have to add it to my list right now. Framing. Amy, this is for you. for your beautiful hair. But I sold my hair to a wigmaker to buy a set of combs for Hermes. Oh, the irony. I sold my hair so I could buy this third set of combs for Zoidberg. Thank you. These'll come in handy for my new hair. Finally I look as pretty as I feel.",

Oh, dear! You've all been very naughty. Very naughty, indeed. Except you, Doctor Zoidberg. This is for you. As for the rest of you, I'll tear off your skin like wrapping paper… and deck the halls with your guts. Yeah? Well, I don't believe in Santa Claus. Come on, everybody. If you don't believe in him, he can't hurt you.",
"Oh, God, the pain! on your naughty asses. Watch out, his belly's shaking like a bowl full of nitroglycerine. Rudolph's nose! He's going to blow! Good thing I got us out of that one. Xmas dinner, everyone. Bender, where did you get that bird? I found it lying in the street, Dig in, everyone! Thank you, sir. You got the toenail. Look, the food isn't what's important. I'm so hungry. The important thing is, we're all together for Xmas. And even though I'm surrounded by robots and monsters and old people.",

"Let's just pray I have the energy to get another beer. You've become a fat sack of crap. Bender, your beer belly's so big your door won't close. And that doesn't make sense. You're coming to the gym. The gym? Excellent! Excellent! For some reason, I'm frisky as a squid on Tuesday. Who's up for a steam? Crustaceans don't like steam. I'll work out with the Nautilus. What up, Dr. Z? Yo, yo. What's up? Give up the rock! Co-ed steam rooms. I love the future. You're in the women's steam room.",
"Ah, futuristic. before genetic engineering. The poor 20th-century women. Hey, handsome. Have room for two? Hey, Leela, look who's the super stud. Someone must have turned down the gravity. More weight! What's that jazz on your head? Enough questions. More weight! More! More! do more reps with less weight. Looks like Zoidberg's finally coming out of his shell! Get it? He's coming out. Nice and gentle. We don't want any unnecessary stress. Is there a doctor in the gym? I'm a doctor! Why's he acting this way? He seemed the most normal.",
"I am normal. Amy, take off these rubber bands and I'll show you. Fool me seven times, shame on you. Fool me eight times, shame on me. Maybe he has a parasite. Maybe he is one. It's sad when a friend goes nuts… and you have to have a clambake and cook him. This won't do. Much better. You can remove these. Moron! There's the problem. Give it to me straight. Is it fin rot? It's fin rot, isn't it? Relax, chum. It's no problem. You're just heavy with male jelly. It's mating season for his people.",
"A time when his behavior is run by the brain in his rump. There's one thing we can do. I'll boil the water. We, I mean you, have to rush him to his ancient home world… which will soon erupt in an orgy of invertebrate sex. Oh, baby, I'm there! Do you understand invertebrate? It's not the word I care about. No need to pack pants. Let's roll! Dr. Zoidberg said I should hold these. Moron! Welcome home, old friend! Just 19 hours until the mating frenzy! Excellent! Excellent! See ya there, Doctor.",
"That's how you say Zoidberg? You didn't have to point out his speech impediment. You're looking less nuts. I'm feeling less nuts. Tomorrow I'll be depositing jelly in the cloacal vents of a female. Catch my drift? Who's the lobsterina? Not sure. I shall attract one today with an erotic display. Your people fall in love so fast. Love? That word's unknown here. I want a female swollen with eggs to accept my genetic material. You and me both. Ah! My old scuttling grounds. Let's pull over.",
"I used to hang out here as a larva. It looked much bigger then. Who's the tough guy now, Vinnie? Look! Outdoor theater! It's the Ceremony of Claw Plock. We fight to the death over honor… and whether abbreviations count in Scrabble. They don't! I didn't come to see two guys. Where do you do your erotic display? Same as your species. The beach! Like whale barf. Then the illusion is complete. I wonder if they're here to watch the erotic display too. Perfect. This ought to make me stand out.",
"He's no different from you organisms… shooting DNA at each other It's offensive! Keep your jelly away from my eggs. So not interested. I've heard that before. What's the point? Why's he still alone? He's a loser, that's why. The lobster equivalent of Fry. I can get any girl, any time. Edna! Edna, it's me, Zoidberg. Remember? From high school. My face was covered with barnacles. I didn't know you were back in town. I heard you became a rich doctor. I've performed a few mercy killings.",
"So, as long as I'm in town, I was wondering if maybe, well. Gee. Yeah, I'm just going through a lot of things right now, and. Look, I carry more eggs than other females. I owe it to our race to pick a mate Maybe a rock star. Or a doctor? I'm sorry. You're just an inferior male specimen. Nice seeing you again. No one will ever mate with me. Not with a puny claw like this. They were giant claws with bodies. You didn't smell as bad. You're right. My stink gland is weak. Smell! You gotta fake like you're in love.",
"Look in her eyes, start crying… and say, I've never been so happy. If a guy ever did that, I'd know it. Wait a second. They've all done that. Even Sean! This loveintrigues me. You're on a date. Ask her to mate. She's not. She just has the largest clutch of eggs. Well, tell her that. Then? Then mating. No. Make up feelings and tell her you have them. Is desire to matea feeling? You're not even trying! The romance and the lies upon lies. Don't worry. The love meister will take you under his wing.",
"Now there's a bird involved? What the. Dr. Zoidberg? Your display failed. Why are you trying to talk to me? I don't know. You just want to talk. I just want to talk. That doesn't make sense. That doesn't make sense. But okay. Tell her she looks thin. You seem malnourished. Do you suffer from parasites? Yes. Thanks for noticing. Ask about her day. Why would I care? You wouldn't. Ask. How was your day? Well, first I got up and had a piece of toast. Then I went to the store.",
"And. Look, she won't shut up. It's normal. Just nod and say, Uh-huh. And then you threw an octopus. It's crazy, but when you talk this way… your obvious deficiencies seem Your genes seem less detrimental. You even stink more. Third date. So I returned his artificial heart. Since then, I've been called Honest Bender. I'd like to propose a toast to coat check number 84. Turn it over. Oh. Edna! Of all the gross crab monsters on this planet… you are the hottest.",
"That's the most beautiful thing. Excuse me. I must powder my flaps. I'm confused. I'm feeling a strange new emotion. Is it love when you care for a female for reasons beyond mating? No. Must be some alien emotion. He's a nice guy. Really. Fry's been telling him what to say. And Fry's a. Do you have idiots on your planet? Fry? Words of such beauty came from the blowhole of that hideous alien? Look, never mind the words. Zoidberg's a doctor. A doctor, honey. Come in. Hello, Fry.",

And if you survive, The law is clear.",
"Fry and Zoidberg shall fight to the death for the beautiful Edna. But I don't want her! The tradition of Claw Plock can't be taken back. It is a recent tradition, only I'm going to rip your swim bladder out and show it to you! This is madness! You're being irrational! Of course I'm being irrational! I'm in love! Right, right. Listen, lady. As you can see… I'm a highly desirable male groaning with jelly. Yet I embrace celibacy to uphold our crazy traditions. One of your friends must die.",

Let Claw Plock begin! Go, Fry! Die with dignity! No! I can't stand to look! Fry! Take a dive! Fellow fish monsters, I don't want to question your stupid civilization… but will killing someone with a nutcracker solve anything? He's my friend. Though a woman has come between us… we'll remain friends.",
"And do you know why? One reason. You bastard! I'll kill you! You bastard! Wait! Stop! Everyone is gone! Edna? Honey? Edna? The frenzy! Oh, the greatest experience in life and I missed it. I'm sorry, doc. The frenzy is over. How will I get rid of my jelly now? I'll lend you this. Fry. What's with the flying jerks? They feast after the frenzy. Once my species passes its genes, it dies. You choose between life without sex and death? It was nice of you to let me fix your arm. Especially after I made an eel out of myself.",

Keeping an eye on the safe? You know it! Lie down and go off-line for a while. All right. You were looking at the atom.",
"Shouldn't you rest up for your shift? Whatever it takes to shut your yapper. I'm just kidding you. Here's a jokeI'm gonna sit here until my shift. Suit yourself, skinbag. That's eight hours. Eight hours of solid boredom. I'm kidding. You're a wonderful man. Finally, the atom is safe. Did you hear maracas? It wasn't space bandidos. Don't let Flexo escape. It appears Flexo has outwitted us all… Bender. By using a sleep ray. Sleep rays exist, right? Then I fell asleep. You were sure right about Flexo.",
"Thanks, Bender. Let's look for him. I've got a map of the ship right here. Keep an eye on Fry. Searching. Why are you looking for Flexo in my underpants? He wasn't here 10 minutes ago, so I thought I'd check again. Well, he wasn't in the kitchen room. Bender, can I hold that map for a second? And leave me high and dry in case of a scavenger hunt? No way. All right, take it! Looks like Flexo got away clean. It's a darn shame. just as we landed. Or maybe he never left at all! Wait.",

Yeah, but I can explainIt's very valuable.",
"I saw him snatch it while Fry slept. That's why I ran to tell Bob Barker. Wait a second. Bender is the evil Bender? Well, not that shocked. I'm sorry we suspected you, Flexo. But with the beard. Don't even bother! You people sicken me! I put my life on the line. This is how you repay me? You can go rot for all I care! I'm just kidding. You guys are all right. I'm so confused.

I'm gonna crash! I swerved to avoid you. Could you tell us where the canisters go? Central filing.",
"Okay. Thank you. Wonderful. Of course I know where it is. I'm grade 20. Where? I can't tell. What do I look like, a grade 16? We're getting nowhere slowly. I'll address this to the filing room. We'll track it with my lojack-a-mater. Cold. Warmer. Don't tell my boss I was asleep. This is it! We'll run in, grab Bender's disk and run out. Got it? We'll never find it. I am Bender. Please insert girder. You're right! Nothing's over if there's hope. Lost something? I should have known you'd come here.",
"And I did. That's why I came. We're through! You're evil. I never want to see you again! Help us for old times' sake? He's lost in the master inpile. It would take an atomic-powered sorter to find him. You rang? Damn it, jump already! Stop hogging the healthy liver! I want to live! Organizing the labor spa rekindled my love of bureaucracy. My Hermes got that hellhole running so that all the physical labor… is done by a single Australian man. How'd you find us? Dr. Zoidberg.",
"It was me! I'm the hero! Request for explanation of incident meeting. Number 1. 0! Number 1. 0, I petition you for an emergency sort… under regulation two. Don't quote me regulations! I was on a committee to review… the color of the book that regulation's in. We kept it gray. I must find the disk with my friend's brain on it. Very well, but your license will be revoked if you fail… to sort the master inpile by closing. That's only four minutes from now.",
"Requisition me a beat. I Was born, there Was a hurricane We had a foot and a half of Water I cried all night BleW my alphabet blocks out of order This boy's born to be a bureaucrat Born to be obsessive and snotty I made my relations file applications To get into my birthday party Something changed When he turned pro Sorting but Wasn't smiling He forgot it's not about rank It's about the filing, people We didn't choose to be bureaucrats Treat people like sWine, make them Stand in line, even if nobody paid us The World looks doWn on bureaucrats We're anal, compulsive and Weird Even if it's not a good idea Said I shouldn't be a surgeon Poo-pooed my electric frankfurter Said I shouldn't fly With one eye I am Bender please insert girder Everybody sing Jamaica Just the bureaucrats Just the grade 19s Sing me home Even if it's not a good idea I'm Bender, baby! Please insert liquor! Congratulations! You finished with two seconds to spare, so I'm demoting you.",
"Good bureaucrats never finish early. That's okay. At least you're back. Not yet. I'm acting bureaucrat of Planet Express. I have some changes to make. Fry, you're fired. Second. Hold on! While I was sorting, I found a document filed by Morgan Proctor. Form B. Notification of Romantic Entanglement. She fraternized me! It's not about you. It refers to my prom date. A date that ended in disappointment. Yes. But you only stamped it four times! No! No! I was young and reckless! You are technically correct.",
"The best kind of correct. I hereby promote you to grade 37. And as for you? Guards! Bring me the forms I need to sign to have her taken away. It looks like I need my heroic bureaucrat back. At severely reduced pay, of course. Better than nothing. Can I get reduced pay too? You got it! In fact, severely reduced pay all around. Come on, wife! Let's blow this joint! Now it's time for my song! When I Was 2 There Was a tidal Wave in. AW. Clone of My Own Good news! The university is bringing me up on disciplinary charges.",
"Wait, that's not good news. Whatever you did, I'm sure there's a good explanation. Yes, but they won't listen. Everyone's always in favor of saving Hitler's brain. But when you put it in the body of a great white shark? Suddenly you've gone too far! Professor Farnsworth, do you know why we've called you here today? Listen to me, you pompous frauds! If I'm going down, I'm taking you all with me! Dean Vernon, I know the truth! It was you driving your hover car that night, not your horse. Dean Epsilon.",
"I know all about your Department of Pool Boy Studies And Dr. Wernstrum? Wernstrum! Actually, professor, we merely called you here to say… surprise. Happy birthday! Surprise! And you, Coach Smalley! Or should I say, Coach Hairpiece? No, professor. It's a surprise party… for your 150th birthday! Good evening, I'm. Sorry. I'm Bender, and I'll be emceeing this roast. They say you can judge a man by the company he keeps. So here's the professor's oldest friend, a grotesque, stinking lobster! Good evening, ladies and germs.",
"That wasn't a joke. I was talking to Dean Streptococcus. Now I'm not saying Professor Farnsworth is old… but if you consider his age, he's likely to die soon. Hey, Ringo? That was the joke. all over again. Where would a professor be without students who love and respect him? Right there! But seriously, of all the former crew members of his delivery ship… our next speaker is by far Captain Musky? I wouldn't want to follow that guy. And now, a man who needs no introduction.",
"Fry, get up there! Thank you. When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, the professor. Then later, Leela made the film. But if I had made it, there would be more topless women on motorcycles. Hubert J. FarnsWorth Was born April 9th, 2851… in NeW NeW York's nerdiest slum, Hell's Laboratory. A precocious child, he learned to read While he Was still in diapers. Soon he became a greasy teenager. Dork alert! After 14 years of graduate school… he settled into the glamorous life of a scientist.",
"Fast cars, trendy nightspots… beautiful Women. The professor designed them all, Working out of his one-room apartment. For 50 years, he Worked at Mom's Friendly Robot Company… Where he created the first robot capable of qualifying for a boat loan. And noW, even as he nears his 150th birthday… the professor retains the fiery passion of youth. Listen to me, you pompous frauds! If I'm going doWn, I'm taking you all With me! How about a few words, professor? I said, words.",
"What a pleasure it is to see my lifetime of accomplishment… summed up in a 3-minute film. My best years are behind me. So much left undone. Funny, funny stuff! My life is over. No, it isn't. You have another 10 years left. another 100 years! No, he couldn't. When you turn 160… robots from the Sunset Squad take you to a mysterious planet… and you never return. Wow, a whole planet of old people. Where is it? Nobody knows. So many loves half-loved. So many inventions half-invented.",
"That damn time machine alone set me back 15 years. If only it'd work, you could go back and not waste your time on it. There's no one to carry on after I'm gone. No one to take over my work and my research and my fabulous fortune. I've got to name a successor! A successor? A successor to the professor? There's no time to lose. a successor-naming machine! The professor's been in his lab for days! I hope he didn't die. Unless he named me his successor. Then I hope he did die. You, the successor? Over my empty shell! The professor will pick me.",
"Only I have his lobster-like tenacity. Up yours, Zoidberg! Up wherever your species traditionally crams things. The only sensible way to pick a successor is with a limbo contest. Kingston rules. Two men go down, one comes up. Look, the professor trusts me with a giant spaceship. He wouldn't trust you with his dentures. Sorry, everyone. But need I remind you, blood is thicker than water. Blood. Thicker. Water. Everyone, I have a very dramatic announcement. So anyone with a weak heart should leave now.",
"Professor? Oh, yes! The announcement. As you all know, I am not long for this world. Yes, we know. One foot in the grave. So I've picked my successor. It's someone in whom I have great faith… though his mind is undeveloped and he's accomplished nothing. My closest living relative… my clone, Qbert Farnsworth. He's horrible! Crud. Can I at least be in charge of your dentures? Where did he come from? I began the cloning process… by removing skin cells from one of the shapelier growths on my back.",
"If he's your clone, why doesn't his nose look like yours? I left him in his first tube too long and he got squished against the side. Is he dumb or just ugly? Let's find out. What? You've never seen a genius's wiener before? No. Never. Well, once in the park. Since I'm going to be in charge… let me examine my so-called crew. If it can so be called. First of all, Dr. Zoidberg… do you even have a medical degree? In a volcano. And why do we need a bending robot around here anyway? What possible use do we have for you? Me no speak-a the English.",
"And why does our space pilot have only one eye? There's someone I'd like you to meet. His name is depth perception. Wow, that hurt. the air! Him pending para un bending. Qbert, come in here. I'll show you something amazing. What is it, a competent employee? I doubt that very much. The little twerp. As my successor, I'm trusting you to carry on my work. These are some of the inventions you'll spend your life finishing. I didn't realize you were the inventor of the junk heap. That's my prizewinning Smell-a-Scope.",
"If a dog craps anywhere in the universe, I won't be out of the loop. And this is my universal translator. Unfortunately, so far… it only translates into an incomprehensible dead language. Bonjour. Crazy gibberish! Don't you have worthwhile inventions? Why, certainly! Step over here. These are the dark-matter engines I invented. They allow my starship to travel between galaxies in mere hours. That's impossible. You can't go faster than the speed of light. Of course not. That's why scientists increased the speed of light in 2208.",
"And what makes my engines truly remarkable is the afterburner… which delivers 200-percent fuel efficiency. Not at all. It's very simple. Then explain it. It came to me in a dream and I forgot it in another dream. Your explanations are pure weapons-grade bologn-ium. Nothing's impossible if you can imagine it. That's what being a scientist No, that's what being It's Elzar, the TV chef! Kill me now, people! How we doing here? Elzar, everything's so good! Are you an ass-kissing machine? Yes, sir! Good one, sir! It's a gem of an evening.",
"I feel so wonderful having someone to take over my life's work. And it's all thanks to Qbert. Look, I may be identical to you in every possible way… but that doesn't mean I'm anything like you. I don't want to be an inventor. I want to be something useful, like a teacher's aide… or a prison guard or a science-fiction cartoon writer. and my dreams… and my wonderful inventions? In your life, your only half-decent invention was me. And I didn't turn out like you wanted either.",
"You folks still doing all right? Oh, yes, Elzar. Turns out I forgot to cook that chicken. Bad news, everyone. I'll be gone… leaving behind only a history of failure and my original hipbones. You see, I've been lying about my age. I'm not actually 150. Oh, vanity, thy name is Professor FarnsWorth. And noW that I have nothing to live for… I've alerted the Sunset Squad robots to take me aWay. Goodbye, cruel world! Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes.",
"And now that I have nothing to live for… I've alerted the Sunset Squad robots to take me aWay. I knoW you're all upset, especially Bender. Well, life goes on. Except for you! I'm sure he's just made a cutting remark… but he doesn't knoW I taped over his soap operas to record this. You bastard! Impossible.",
"No one knows where they take them. Nothing's impossible! You'd know that if you really took after him, like I do. You're his uncle, dummy. He takes after you! Wait a second! That means I also take after you! I think I know how to find him. Lay it on us, big boots. If this can pick up his odor, we may have a chance to save him. I think not. As you probably don't know… odors are made up of particles that can't travel through space. I'm zeroing in on him. Letters to the editor! It's the professor! To the flying machine! Uturn! We'll never find this place.",
"Robots are good at keeping secrets. No, we're not, you little bed wetter. Sorry. There it is! The Near-Death Star! We'll say the professor escaped and we're bringing him back. Fry, dress up like a 160-year-old man. I'm on it… the illusion is so perfect I almost forgot I was looking at an idiot! They may ask for a DNA sample. I'd like to see them find it. This plan is impossible. We don't even have a sample of his DNA. I think I know where to get some. Because you're too ugly to be a wart.",
"Your Medicare dollars at work. Halt! Identify this guest. This is Professor Hubert Farnsworth. Escaped? No one escapes. This guest does not look 160. What? I'm old. Listen. Hey, you kids! Get off the lawn! Old people are often concerned that there are children on their lawns. No denying that. But we'll need to verify his identity with a DNA sample. Got a hot, steaming batch right here. We only needed one cell. Keep the change, buddy! Stupid robot. Did your hump just say something? I've got talking hump syndrome.",
"Identity confirmed. Return this shambling shuffleboarder to his room. Sounds nice. Prepare to be surprised. So this is where they stick old people! It's horrific! It does keep them from driving. Brace yourself for the worst. And yet he looks so natural. What's happening? He's hooked up to life support. We have to disconnect him carefully… or the shock could kill him. Freeze! Get them! I mean, seize them! We'll probably make it, but we might not! It's impossible! We'll never fit! Come on, Leela! Step your big boot down on the gas pedal! They've blown out one of our engines! Only the professor knows how.",
"Try shocking him! Your social security check is late! Stuff costs more than it used to! Young people use curse words! Damn, we'll have to fix it ourselves! We can't, you bastard! No one knows how it works! Nothing is impossible! I know how the engines work now. It came to me in a dream. The engines don't move The ship stays where it is, and the engines move the universe around it! Nothing's a complete load. Not if you can imagine it. That's what being a scientist is about. Right, professor? Let's ride.",
"Good neWs, everyone! He's completely recovered. All right! I'm as spry as a 140-year-old. See? I only broke one ankle. What happened to you in the drawer? I was hooked up to a bizarre virtual world that seemed absolutely real. I was at a facility in Florida… with hundreds of other old people. All day we'd play bingo, eat oatmeal and wait for our children to call. It's more horrible than anything I could imagine. Thank you all for saving me. Especially you, my little clone. No matter what you decide to do with your life, I'm still proud of you.",
"I've already decided. Dad, when I grow up I want to be just like you. Oh, don't worry, son. You will. Incidentally, read up on the condition known as wandering bladder. No reason. No reason at all. Exciting news! The pet license I requisitioned for Nibbler is here. I didn't know you cared about Nibbler. Dream on! I want to put him in a sack, toss the sack in the river… and hurl the river into space. But I like filling out requisitions. And these were some doozies! Great Jah's dreadlocks! There's been a mix-up.",
"This isn't the pet license, it's a fishing license! And it's mandatory! The exact center of the Atlantic Ocean! for fish to congregate! We're in international waters? Indeed so. Falcon, this is Blue Raven. The goose has nested. Guess what you're accessories to? The sun, the sea air, good friends. Leela's right. Fishing blows. Let's make it interesting. Why not? Everybody kick in 5 bucks! Wasn't that interesting? Bender! This contest is as good as over. I once caught a fish this big. Oh, yeah? I once caught a fish You're both out of your league! Because you're looking at a woman who owns a harpoon.",
"Harpoon my ass! Let's see now. Which bait to use? Crickets? Squid? Chicken necks? I am willing to offer my services as a bait critic. These sardines, for example, are bland and tasteless. And these dry, stringy night crawlers, though juicy. Very, very juicy. I don't believe this! It's eating my bait! Beat it, you mooching crawdad! Hey, Fry. Check out my laser-guided fishing rod. Quiet, you'll scare away the fish. Fine. I'll head to the other side. Good luck fishing on this side! I can hit a fish between the eyes from 20 yards.",
"Yeah? I can hit a shrimp! A shrimp? I find it a bit hard to believe that. Gather around, chumps! I got the winner. So, this is where you shop for your boots! A couple more of those and you'll have yourself a fish stick. A fish this fine belongs in a fish nugget-style chunklet. It's bigger than anything My small intestine. Bingo! Whatever it is, it's 20 times heavier than a boot. You'll never catch anything with that primitive technology. What you need is this fish pheromone. The most potent aphrodisiac known to fishkind.",
"I am so into you! Bender, I just caught a fish this big! Quit exaggerating! Screw this! If I'm not gonna catch a fish, I might as well not catch a big fish. There. Like most problems, this one can be solved with bending. Bender, be careful! That's the ship's diamond filament tether. It's unbreakable. Then, why do I have to be careful? It belonged to my grandmother. My Manwich! Wake up! I've got something. And this time, it's alive! Dr. Zoidberg, since when do you even wear boots? I wasn't wearing it.",
"I was eating it! Come on, let's go home. Sunburn! My fabulous body! It's ruined! What happened to my parasol? It wasn't here when I took your umbrella. I put sun block on you. It didn't work. Come on, Bender. Pull in your line and let's go. Hey! I'm snagged! It's not snagged. The mechano-man has caught something! It's coming up! It's diving! It's pulling us under! Into the ship! By cutting the unbreakable diamond filament. with my friends. Hello? Forty-eight hundred! Fifty hundred! Five thousand feet! Dear Lord! That's over How many atmospheres can the ship withstand? anywhere between zero and one.",
"Is someone bending girders? We'll be crushed if we don't equalize. We're gonna die! Wait! I'll be back in a minute. You did it, Fry! People, it's far, far worse than we thought. Good as new! Except we're 3 miles down below, have no food, and the ship won't work. Tempers are wearing thin. Let's hope some robot doesn't kill everybody! Don't panic. There are rules for situations like this. The first order of business is lunch. I suggest a nice lobster Zoidberg. I mean lobster Newburg. I mean Dr.",
"Zoidberg. Okay, everyone calm down. The professor and I will work on the ship. Bender, ZoidbergSince you can survive under water… you'll go out and find food. I better go too. They don't know what I like. No! The pressure will crush you like a snake under a sugarcane truck! Not necessarily. This is a chance for Fry to test my experimental anti-pressure pill. I can't swallow that! Well, then, good news! It's a suppository. How are you doing there? Glad to hear it! Look at me! I'm Dr.",
"Zoidberg, homeowner! Careful, Fry. I think that flag may be poisonous. Ahoy, mateys! I shanghaied us some hearty grub! The laws of science be a harsh mistress. Okay. But I'm not carrying it upstairs. What is it, Fry? You want lemonade? You saw a parade? Your student loans have been repaid? Then how about lending your old pal Zoidberg a few bucks, Mr. Millionaire. Fry, swallow your food, then talk. A mermaid! You think you saw a mermaid? No, I did see a mermaid. She was wearing a tube top.",
"Yeah, right! Sure she did! You are simply hallucinating, you moron! What's so far-fetched about mermaids? There's all sorts of weird sea creatures here in the future. Like Dr. Zoidberg! Fry is suffering from ocean madness. Every time something good happens to me, you say it's madness. Or I'm drunk. Or I ate too much candy. Well, I saw a real mermaid! And I wish for once my friends had the decency to believe me! Ocean madness. He may have ocean madness, but that's no excuse for ocean rudeness.",
"Ocean madness. Yeah, right! It's always something, ain't it? It's her! Bender, wake up! She's here, wake up! Oxygen! Here you go, darling. Hey! I can breathe and talk, I'm sorry, my accent's atrocious. Hi, my name is Umbriel. I'm Fry. So, am I gonna drown? Of course not! Just stay calm and let the gentle currents relax your every muscle. Did it just get warmer? I can't believe you're real. I like your tail. You're sweet! I like those wiggly doodads coming out of your hips. Thanks. They're called pants.",
"This here is a volcanic vent. The water is over 4000 degrees. No kidding. Did it just get colder? Tell me more about that bizarre landie world you come from. Is there water there too? Sure, sometimes it falls from the sky. And sometimes it doesn't. Mr. Fry, you do go on! you find me fascinating. Even if I'm not claiming to be a jewel thief or lion-tamer. Lions? There are sea lions on the land? Yep! We call them land sea lions. I've almost reconfigured the ship's propulsion system. We can leave as soon as the papier-maché is dry.",
"Where's Fry? I didn't kill him. You? No, I've been busy. He must've gone looking for that mermaid. Poor demented honky. It's ocean madness, all right. Sailors call it aqua dementia. The deep down crazies. The wet willies. The screaming moist. We'll form a search party. We'll need oxygen. I got it covered. In the event of emergency, my ass can be used as flotation device. You've all taken your pressure pills, right? Yes! Stop asking! I've got a scent, over here where the water gets warmer.",
"Bend me! Dude! An ancient sunken city! Are the old legends true? city of Atlanta! Welcome to Atlanta! Folks here call me The Colonel. Have some breathers, courtesy of our chamber of commerce. This is uncomfortable and humiliating! in the form of a suppository. Y'all enjoy your stay! Tourism's our main source of income. So see the sights, spend some money! Please don't leave! Fry, I knew you were alive! I owe you 10 bucks, Hermes. The most amazing thing happened! It's two-for-one Tuesday at Krispy Kreme.",
"Plus there's mermaids. my daughter, Umbriel. Umbriel, these are some Yankees. So Atlanta was an American city in your time? I think it was just an airport. They had a place to buy nuts. No! Ancient Atlanta was more than just a Delta hub! It was a vibrant metropolis. The equal of Paris or New York. That's right, honey. Whatever you say. Loot at these fabulous ruins. Turner Field… the Coca-Cola bottling plant… the airport. airport end up underwater? That's a story only to be told in the chamber of commerce video.",
"Atlanta Was a city, landlocked. Hundreds of miles from the area We noW call the Atlantic Ocean. Yet so desperate the city's desire for tourism… that they moved offshore, became an island and bigger Delta hub. Until the city overdeveloped, and it started to sink. KnoWing their fate, the quality people ran aWay. Ted Turner, Hank Aaron, Jeff FoxWorthy… the guy Who invented. the magician, and the other so-called gods of our legends.",
"Though gods they Were. Also Jane Fonda Was there. The others remained behind… on their porches With rifles… and one day evolve into mermaids… and sing and dance and ring in the neW. Hail Atlanta! The magician? Wouldn't it take millions of years to evolve into mermaids? Normally, yes. But the caffeine really sped things up. That stuff's wonderful! When Umbriel brought home this carpetbagger, I was against it. But damn if old legs here ain't grown on me! Shucks, Colonel! It's very nice here, but we should go.",
"I miss me wife and oxygen. We all miss our loved ones and gases. Come on, Fry. Wait, I'm not going with you. What about your life on the surface? You don't belong here. She's right. Sure they got the Braves, but it's a third-rate symphony. Fry, you half-mad, half-insane maniac! Be reasonable! Do you realize if you. you'll permanently adapt to the pressure? I don't even understand it! You'll never be able to return to the surface. I don't care. I've got everything I want right here.",
"I'm bored! Let's go! You know, Fry, I've got a little place just outside town. Sorry, I'm trying to join the country club. Y'all come back now, you hear? Let's go, damn it, let's go! for me as well. Whatever. Later! My home! It burned down! How did this happen? That's a good question! So that's where I left my cigar. That just raises further questions! These last 24 hours have been I want you to make a mer-woman out of mer-me. Mercy! I do believe I'm getting the vapors. I'm a little confused too! How do I.",
"I'm not your first, am I? I lay my eggs, then I leave and you release your fertilizer. Why couldn't she be the other kind of mermaid… with fish part on top, and lady part on bottom? Now who's gonna escort me to the Debutante Ball? What about that rich young dugong from Macon? The engine modifications are complete. Prepare for launch. Wait! Wait for me! Don't leave me here! And so, in honor of his record-breaking catch… I'm proud to award Bender this check for $1000! My Manwich! Are you all right? What happened? What about Umbriel? Turns out I loved her, but I wasn't in love with her.",
"Trouble in bed. It's great to have you back, buddy! This is no record! I'm giving it to some giant orphans. Bender, you're hurting me! Hey, I'm trying to sleep in here! Hail Atlanta! Bender Gets Made I'm gonna see my favorite chef… TV's Elzar! This is the greatest second of my life! No, this one is! Wait, that one was worse. Ah, so far so good on this one! NoW, here he isChef, restaurateur… author of Cooking Slugs For Dinner and Cooking Dinner for Slugs… Elzar! All right! Yeah! Yeah, baby! Whoo! Elzar! All right! Elzar, you're my god! Please sign this sketch I drew of you! Elzar! Bless you! Now, this is why I prefer your non-stick robots.",
"All right! Yeah! I hope you folks like Cajun food. Because we're making down-home Neptune-style gumbo. Step oneBoil some oysters in a pot of Neptune-style gumbo. Boiled? Interesting! Bender, try to be a little quieter. Now and then, knock it up a notch with your spice weasel. Yeah! Bam it again! Knock it up a notch! Who let him into the studio? Come on! Work that weasel! Quit holding out! If you stop interrupting, all right. Against my will, I'll knock it up a notch. I gotta film this notch-up knocking.",
"Think fast! My eye! I'm blind! Tell me, doctor, how's my cyst? Grande. I don't like this doctor. I've lost more patients than he's treated. A grayish blob? Right. And this one? A grayish blob? Not as right that time. You have some corneal irritation. Nice try, little boy. You may have textbook knowledge and a real diploma… but I have more skill in my claw than you have in your whole body! You seem tense. Try these. Sure. Butter me up with candy. Well, it won't work, sonny! Why always the fighting? Your eye needs rest.",
"Wear this patch for a week. A week? What do you think, Dr. Zoidberg? Thanks for the help, Leela. Leela! We're right here! I'm not deaf! I just have to wear a patch. No! It looks so nice, I think I might get one too. It's Elzar! I could wet my pants! You're all invited to my restaurant. I'll bam up a dinner you won't forget! All right! Hooray for blind-ey! Oh, God. I'm coming down! Watch your mouth because your taste buds are going on vacation. I made you each your own special meal, so dig in! It's the biggest platter I've ever seen! Jerk chicken, jerk beef, jerk pork! Is there any meat he can't jerk? The king crab is to die for! Look, a tiny, edible crown! Oh, Fry! You gotta try this sterno-nicoise.",
"It's robot food. It's so good! Just try a little. No, really, I don't. Are you all right? Oh, yeah, the salad's fantastic! So fresh. Oh, my! That steamed carrot Enjoy the dinner? Are you kidding? God, yes, Elzar! I enjoyed cooking for you. And to make everything square… I want you to have Take care of that whenever you want. You're charging us, after you blinded me? I made a nice meal. This ain't a charity. Twelve hundred dollars? We don't have that! Especially not him.",
"They took away my credit cards. I know how to take care of this. No problem. You're all under arrest. It's a stone cold shame. He's making a break for it! I was picking my nose. Picking his nose! Get him! My daddy owned a restaurant and punks like you made him fail. Don't hit me! I'm brittle! Wait! I've got the perfect solution! Listen to the robot! I love cooking, and he needs help, right? No question. How about I work to pay off our debt? I don't know. I try to hire people who are less unbearable.",
"Bender's a model employee! And hardworking. He's made of candy. All right! Yeah! You better keep your nose clean. That'll be easy. I never wear it. Time for my precious 10 a. m. meeting! Where is Leela? I'm here. And I'm getting along fine, thanks. longer than usual. Nibbler took me through the zoo. Don't be embarrassed about needing help. I could do your makeup. I don't need help. My favorite artist is Picasso! I'm off to the restaurant. Someone can fill in for me. I'll build someone to fill in for you! A gamma-powered mechanical monster.",

Don-Bot, please. I can't make the loan payment. Look into your hard drive and open your mercy file. File not found. That's a warning. Thank you, Don-Bot. Joey. Clamps. Donny-B. We got a big score planned, but we need some muscle. This guy's got the strength of an ox. He needs a nickname! How about Clamps? That's my name, you numbskull! Don't make me clamp you one! It's gritty, and I can keep my monogrammed slippers.",
"Good thinking! Hey! This score ain't gonna be easy. There may be some death killing. Well, Blotto? You in? It's funny. I always wanted to be a gangster. The answer is yes! Since we'll be committing crimes… you'll want an alibi. An alibi, huh? I don't feel good. I'm genuinely sick. We gotta eat our blast-off sundaes! I can't move. Oh, I think I'm gonna output.

I admire that. They won't know what clamped them! Too bad you can't see… because there's a ship shooting at somebody.",
"I'm taking evasive action! Stop bothering me! I need full concentration! Eyes are for chumps. Their desire to live shows me no respect. Roll down a window and start shooting.

"We're the Robot Mafia. The entire Robot Mafia. We're taking the cigars. You can't! Unless you let us live! Then you'll get off. Blindfold them before they see us some more. That's a joke at my expense. Well, who's laughing now? Where's Blotto? He should be here, learning the trade. Sorry I'm tardy, old bean. I was enjoying a watercress sandwich. He's classier than I thought. He sounds familiar. My word, what have we. ? Nothing to see here! This crew list lists a robot. Okay. I want you to find him and plug him.",
"Then unplug him. I got a surprise for that guyI can be quite rough. Poor Bender. Oh, I don't feel good. Chew on this! What ho! Now let's mafia things up. Joey, burn the ship. Clamps, burn the crew. Donny, give me a chance here, huh? Let me take care of the dirty work. Hey, I like your attitude. And your accent. Keep it up and I might get you your own pair of clamps. He's gonna get clamps? We may not have much time… so let's spend all of it talking about Bender. He was like a computer that ran on magic.",

It really hurt. This is the big moment. I can take my patch off. I'll do the snipping. After all, I do have the proper equipment. That gangster I saw! Professor? Where were you last night? Where am I now? They sent a child to kill me! I'm not going without a fight! Fine kick, sir. But I'm here to deliver your cut from the heist.",
"Oh, sweet legal tender! Tell the Don-Bot I quit organized crime. I'll stick to the regular kind. It's funny. With you sick and Leela blind… only I know what went on. And maybe someday I won't listen. Futurama is brought to you by Molten Boron. Nobody doesn't like Molten Boron! The Problem with Popplers I hate the Moochers.

So I've made you my sole heir. The day I die, you'll be a very wealthy woman. Oh, my, yes. Incredibly wealthy. The day I die. Because you're so un-impulsive. What have I done? Okay, try to be nonchalant. All right, you're nonchalant. Don't rub our noses in it. Sweet anteater of Santa Anita! The professor's been eaten! After I flush some things.",
"Police? Nosy meddlers. I happen to have mail-order degrees in Murder-ology and Murder-onomy. Zoidberg is afoot! Perhaps his files can help. Citation for Public Nudity. Another one. A new will, naming. You! As his sole heir! What does that prove? It shows you killing him. All right, anteater number one. Was it anteater number two? Don't stick your tongue out at me! I need a name! What are you hacking off? My torso? It is! My precious torso! Hermes, quiet! I'm deducing things! Got disposal trouble? Shocking about the professor.",
"And now Hermes is missing. Well, doesn't affect me. Hermes' dreadlocks? And his arm? Food in the disposal. Hair and flesh go in the trash! I couldn't stop. Wait. Don't you care Ain't nothing wrong with murder… as long as I can wet my beak. I prefer the word extortion. The xmakes it sound cool. Wait, not the microwave! No more killing. Honk, honk! Sporty go-cart, Leela! So hip and sexy! So unlike you. Got any gum? Everyone's here. Who are you? Scruffy, the janitor. I've never seen you before.",
"I've never seen you neither. I've called you all here to watch me gradually solve the crime. One of you is a big murderer! The killer left one fatal clue. The boot print on this lab coat. Couldn't be me. I never wear boots. This is preposterous! Obviously, the murderer is. My next clue came at 4:15, when the clock stopped. Two hours later, at 4:15… I discovered the murdered body of Amy's dead, deceased corpse. I know who killed them people. In Scruffy's opinion, it were.",
"The crime is unsolvable. A letter from my friend Bender. Dear Doctor Jerk-berg, if you're reading this, I'm dead. The murderer was. My God! It can't be! The murderer, it was. I'm bored. You're boring. What's on TV? on your way out? Lobster. You want some? Sure. I think I figured out those deaths. Are we near an Indian graveyard? Then it was you! What's come over me? I killed one person on impulse. Then another. And another. That covers three. Now, to make sure you won't talk.",
"I'm gonna have to do something really impulsive! So, what do you think of the impulsive new me? I really like it. Who else has a question for the machine? Scruffy? Fry? I have one. What if Bender was giant? We already saw that. I know. I want to see it again. No, ask something less stupid. What if I never came to the future? There, now that question What would happen if Fry never came to the future? Hello? Pizza delivery for… I. C. Wiener. Oh, crud. Here's to another lousy millennium.",
"You're going back in the toilet! A rip in the very fabric Hey, look! An ugly, scared guy! Is one of you I. C. Wiener? If that's his pizza, then I am. You believe me about the monsters, right? There's only three monsters, kid. Dracula, Blacula and Son of Kong. Now quit picking your nose and knead that dough! The usual, Professor Hawking? No, I'd like something good. Hawking, you're all right! Stephen Hawking! Didn't you invent gravity? Sure. Why not? Has anyone ever seen a hole in space with monsters in it? If I'm the first, I'll call it a Fry Hole.",
"There is no need to Worry. I must go. There is much to do. Hawking, your pizza! Toss it in the garbage. There he is. Seize him. Who are you? I'm Al Gore. These are my V. P. Action Rangers. Our sole duty is to prevent disruption in the space-time continuum. Isn't your sole duty to break ties in the Senate? That, and protect the space-time continuum. You want to see my Fry Hole? Oh, yes.

Bishop to knight 4. Not every mission can be solved Where am I? You're in a terrestrial transport module. What's going on? It's about that rip in space-time. I call it a HaWking Hole. Hey, I saw it first! Who Will The Journal of Quantum Physics believe? Apparently, something was supposed to happen but didn't.",
"So we had to beat you with rackets. If that event doesn't occur… the universe will be destroyed. As an environmentalist, I'm against that. So then I almost fell into this thingy. I call it a HaWking Chamber. But I missed and wanged my head. Well, obviously that wang Let's finish the job! No, wait! There must be a peaceful. Hold him doWn. Something's wrong! Murder isn't working. Let's try something else. I'm getting an idea! What if he was meant to be frozen? Yes, shove him in the tube.",
"There he is again! He brought nerds! Hurry, get in before the universe collapses! I'll need a weapon to fight drunken robots! Here, take my plus-one mace! Okay. Here I go. What could go wrong? Great. The universe Was destroyed. Then where are we now? I can darn well tell you where we're not. The universe. Eternity with nerds. It's a Star Trek convention all over again! Anyone want to play Dungeons & Dragons? Sure. I'm a 10th-level vice president. That was preposterous. Stephen Hawking in a pizzeria.",

A black-bordered envelope. Someone you know must have died. I hope it was one of my enemies. Oh, no! My uncle Vladimir! I'm sorry.",
"When's the funeral? Tomorrow, at the family castle. Followed by the reading of his will. Well, I'm rich. Goodbye, losers, Come on! It'll be fun. Pardon me, my good simpleton. Could you take us to yon castle? Some say unholy things happen up there. For example, all of us say that. Superstitious robot mumbo jumbo. Mumbo, perhaps. Jumbo, perhaps not. With your science, are you closer to understanding… the mystery of how a robot walks or talks? Yes, you idiot! The circuit diagram is here on the inside of your case.",
"I will go this far and no further. And so we commend Vladimir's remains to the earth. Filings to filings. Rust to rust. To my Ioyal butler, You There, for decades of service… I leave a pittance to be paid in 20 installments… of 1/20th of a pittance each. To my lazy, spoiled son, Tandy, who never learned the value of a dollar… I leave my entire $10 million fortune. To my loving nephew, Bender… if he's not responsible for my death, I leave my castle.",
"Let's stay there tonight! On condition that he spend one night in it. Oh, man! There's always a catch. I get a good vibe from this place. Nice long dinner table… quiet, well-behaved spiders, graveyard-adjacent. Yep, it's gonna be. That painting's eyes are watching me! Motor eye sensors attached to motion detectors. So does my butt, but I don't frame it and put it on the wall. Although. I don't know, but it's infectious. This place is haunted. Don't be silly, man. The last ghost died 200 years ago.",
"The last human ghost. But robot ghosts? 0101100101. What does it mean? It's just gibberish. Uncle Vladimir! Come, Bender. You'll like being dead. They said that about being alive! Join us. Join us. Join us. Just as I suspected. These robots were buried in improperly shielded coffins. Their programs leaked into the wiring through this old modem… allowing them to project themselves as holograms. Of course! It was so obvious! That sequence of words I said made perfect sense.",
"We really should tell Bender there's nothing to be afraid of. Bender, wake up! Quick, does anyone have any liquor? Bender, what happened? Somebody ran me over! And not with a normal hover car. It crept along on round rubber feet, Poor Bender. Seeing things. You've been drinking too much. Or too little. Anyway, not the right amount. Maybe he has. Look at these tracks. I think Bender may be telling the truth. Bender, you look awful. I prescribe makeup. Here! It just so happens I have my Mary Kay sample case.",
"I just need sleep. I had nightmares about cars running people over. Many dream of a fresh new look. And Mary Kay can make those dreams come true. Look! They found those same rubbery tracks in New New York. A hit-and-run by the robot porno theater. Robot porno theater? I was in that general area last night. Whoever ran me down out on the moors followed me back here! No one's trying to run you over. Stop being a big hallucinating baby. Yeah? Could a big hallucinating baby I'm scared!

So, what are you wearing tomorrow? Where. ? What the. ? Transmission fluid? Where have I been? What happened? Gets out of here, youse lousy bum! Please, I'm scared. We all are. It's the human condition. That's why I put on this tough guy I passed out around midnight, much earlier than usual. When I woke up, I found these in my chest cabinet.",
"Relax. You were probably just shooting big fuzzy craps. No! I think I may have hurt someone. Lord, I'm on the verge of a nervous meltdown. You're scaring me. You're going wacko! Right. I need professional help. And damn the expense! Damn the expense! You have nothing to worry about. Except a nightmarish life of unremitting horror! For you see, you are a were-car. A were-car? The car that ran you down was a were-car. It beamed the virus to you through its demonic headlights! That's crazy.",
"Yes. So crazy that it must be true! Each midnight, when your clock resets to 0… your hardware reconfigures into a murderous car. I can't keep running people over. I'm not famous enough Yes. But you must be willing to pay a terrible price. Based on this ancient read mefile… your only hope is to destroy the first were-car. In its death throes, the car will beam out the virus' uninstall program… ridding you of the curse. Otherwise, I can never die? Sure you can die! You want to die? No! There's still too many things I don't own! Then live on.",

"Bender, no! Fry, stay back! You jerk! I thought I was your best friend! What kind of two-timing kill-mobile are you? He's supposed to murder his closest friend, which was me. But he went for you, not even trying to second-degree-murder me. Bender crushed my foot. Stop rubbing it in! Oh, God! Fry, I'm so glad to see you. Did I hurt you? Not physically. Why not ask your new best friend Leela? I tried to run you over? It was very sweet of you. It doesn't mean anything. I have love enough for two.",
"Words. Nothing but sweet words turning into bitter orange wax in my ears. Enough with the feelings. To cure Bender, we've got to hunt down the original were-car. Cursed. Got it. Whatever. The tracks lead here. Thanks, eagle eye. He should be in robot form. But be careful. Many robots are stupid and violent. I wish I was stupid and violent. We'd see what's what. I'd pound him till. Get ye to your houses, ye ignorant villagers! We aren't ignorant villagers. We're sophisticated New New Yorkers.",
"Stop! What are ye doing? Whaling on the original were-car, which is you, jerk! Ye think me be he? Nee. I mean no. I was given the curse many a year ago… while on a bird watching trip to The Arctic. by a vicious motorized sled. The natives called it the abominable snowmobile. It's true. I ran over that bird-watching jerk and 100 others. Even my best friend from aromatherapy school. I once had a best friend who liked to smell things with me. Alas, I'm not the original were-car.",
"I got the curse while taking a class from a famous robot actor. You know him as… Calculon. O fate most cruel, would that my acting skills… might avail me a sword to slay this wretched curse. Let me explain. It all began one fateful night Whoa, whoa! You're 1000 years old? Your bio says you're 27. Lies! I change my identity and appearance… every decade to avoid suspicion. I was all of history's great acting robots. Acting Unit 0. 8, Thespo-mat, David Duchovny.",
"Are you the first were-car or not? No. But you're near the end of your search. by the original were-car. Give us a name, MacButt! The year was 2019, and I was just a lowly roboton working… in an automotive research lab. I was working on Project Satan… a savage car built from the evil parts of the world's most evil cars. The steering wheel from Hitler's car, the signal from Charles Manson's VW. Knight Rider's windshield wipers. Knight Rider wasn't evil. His windshield wipers were.",
"It didn't come up in the show. Only after finishing Project Satan… did they discover they had made a horrible mistake. For you see, it was pure evil. What happened to Project Satan? It's either in Paris or much more likely… still in the abandoned Distract the were-car… and I'll kill it by plugging its exhaust pipe with this silver potato. There it is. It looks so unhappy. Excuse me, are you Project Satan? Don't be afraid. We know what you are. out of your misery? Misery? What misery? I love killing people! Squishing them till their organs squirt out like chunky mustard! Look, everyone loves killing people, but I don't wanna hurt my friends.",
"Oh, no! It's midnight! Hey, this is starting to feel pretty good. Fry, distract him! Hey, Project Satan! Over here! I'm a blind pedestrian. 20 points! Oh, no! There's no exhaust pipe! That's right, thanks to Ed Begley Jr.'s electric motor… the most evil propulsion system ever conceived! Take whichever one you want. Oh, boy! I feel like a car in a candy store! He's trying to kill me! Oh, thanks, Bender. Bender, you're cured! But what happened to Fry? He's my best friend and I killed him! I never felt so empty inside.",
"Bender, I'm alive! You didn't hurt me at all! But I know you wanted to. And that's what matters. Here's to you. That's my last beer, you bastard! The gum with the breath-freshening power of ham. And it pinkens your teeth All right, sergeant, $100 of Pixie Stix and porno mags… with your 5 percent military discount, comes to $95. Forty cents. You forgot our Only for military people. What? This is the worst kind of discrimination! The kind against me! Look, our policy is.",
"I hate you. Okay, now I'm mad. Full price for gum? That dog won't hunt, Monsignor. Hello. We're here because we love our planet. Sign here, patriots. You'll get your discount cards. Can we use the cards to buy gum, then quit the Army? Playing you all for chumps? Correct. There's no obligation. Unless, of course, war were declared. War were declared. Be careful, Fry. If you kill anyone, make sure to eat their heart…",
"Their rich, tasty courage. I don't want you to worry about your jobs. That's why I'm firing you now. I want to enlist. They always die if I'm not there. Sorry. The Army's policy is men only. Shameful, I agree. In the old days, I proudly fought with female troops, shoulder to shoulder. After some deadly blunders caused by distracting low-cut fatigues… and harmless pinching, the Army decided women weren't fit. Not when I'm in charge. Someone should teach you a lesson.",
"If it's a lesson in love, I suffer from a very sexy learning disability. Men, you're lucky. Soon you'll be fighting for your planet. Many of you will die for it. A few will be forced through a fine mesh screen. Great. We're gonna die. And this ham gum is all bones. Now, to present the logistics of our mission… welcome the original Gerber Baby… Earth President Richard M. Nixon. This is the brass ring, fellas. Planet Spheron One. A desolate, ugly planet.",
"Questions? Why is this planet worth dying for? Can't say, you're the one who'll die. So we'll know, who's the enemy? We know nothing about their language… history, or appearance. But we can assume thisThey stand for everything we don't stand for. you look like dorks! They look like dorks! I'm gonna- What's the matter, private? Tent got your tongue? Kif, write that down and send it to Humor in Uniform. That guy makes Speedy Gonzales look like Regular Gonzales.",
"That recruit is phenomenal! Yes. He edged out my old mark by two seconds. And 1 6 minutes. And 1 2 hours. I do plan to finish someday, Kif. Good hustle, soldier. Sorry, sir. I was still in attack mode. You know how testosterone is. As a bubbling Crock-Pot of male hormones, I sure do. What's your name, private? Lee, La, Man. La Man. Lemon! Lee Lemon, sir. Lemon, you're a man's man. A man's man's man. More importantly, your hand, while firm and manly. What's your lotion? Pert and Popular.",
"Roger that. Get me 1 0 cases of Pert and Popular. What about your Jergens? Squirt it on some homeless man with dry elbows. Private Lee Lemon may well be the finest recruit I've ever seen. That young man fills me with hope. And some other emotions that are weird and deeply confusing me. Now that's a nice rosé. Anyway, we open up the panda crate and the thing's dead. True story. That's whatever you were talking about for you. Mind if we sit with you? We're all guys here. Sweaty, hairy, gassy guys.",
"Good point. I guess. You're my kind of soldier. A foul-mouthed, barrel-chested, beer-bellied pile of ugly muscle. I have a thing for this girl at work. Blond, or Chinese, or Cyclops? She sounds sweet. But sweet girls aren't for you. You hard-fighting, hard-farting, ugly son of a- Stop flattering me! Ten hut! If it isn't Lee Lemon… the flaming star of Brannigan's Rough Rangers. Lemon, do you like to read? I got a great book on tape. It's about life in ancient Greece.",
"Sir, the alarm! I think I'd better- Don't talk. Just go. We're now in position above Spheron One. This is the moment we trained for all yesterday afternoon. Now, the battle plan. The key to victory is the element of surprise. Surprise! It's creepy. This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. And then the battle's not so bad? Right, I forgot about the battle. What's happening? The enemy! They're balls! Charge your gun, Fry! Watch where you're shooting, private! Give this to my son.",
"Wait. I didn't tell you where he lives. Your son might also like those boots. Cover us, buddy! You got the only wounded-up positron shooter! Fry, you emu-bellied coward! Bender, no! If they put me on a stamp, tell them to use the young Bender. Incoming wounded! All personnel, report to operating tent four! I mean, five! Repeat, four. Ready to operate? But first, I have to perform surgery. Priest. Next patient! Leave some for the enemy to kill. Leave him alone! He has twice your training.",
"Yeah, he's a doctor and a butcher. This is how it starts. First jokes, then the heavy stuff. When will the killing end? Look at this sissy. While others fought and died pointlessly… he was hiding, wallowing in his own cowardice. That wasn't cowardice. I'm depromoting you. Kif, what's the most humiliating job? Being your assistant. Wrong! Being your assistant. Private, henceforth, you'll be Kif's assistant. That's not bad. You speak when I say so, worm! I'm afraid he's gone.",
"Doc, I ain't dead! Excuse me, I believe I'm the doctor. Believing it won't make it true. It isn't a war. It's a murder. It isn't war, it's murder! Bender, old buddy, hang in there! Here lies the bravest soldier I've ever seen since me. I order that he be melted down and made into a statue of himself. Slow down, I'm up to something here. I want this robot fixed. Fixed like Kennedy fixed the 1 960 election. Damn bean-eating war hero! Ready to operate, doc? But first, I have to perform surgery.",
"Prewar scotch. Welcome, lieutenant. Looking sharp. I got wheels! With clickity-clackers! Where's the little umbrella? It's what makes a scotch on the rocks! Actually, sir. Make me a new one. Use a brush, you dunderhead! And mix these mixed nuts! I see two almonds touching! Listen, this war is in danger of going all quagmire on me. So I am sending you on one last mission. A mission of peace. You'll negotiate with their leaders, the Brain Balls. They've got lots of brains and lots of chutzpa.",
"Joining you is our top peace negotiator, Henry Kissinger. How are you? Is he any good? Looking like that, he talked his way into Jill St. John's bed. A little lower. Lower. Lower. A lot lower. Lower. Private Lemon! No need to leave. My stall just became free. Maybe you should put on a towel. I'm trying the new lotion you recommended. If I accidentally put too much on my hands, I could rub it on you. Brannigan! My God, cover yourself. I didn't live 1 000 years to look at another man's gizmo.",
"Sorry, Mr. President. I didn't realize. Kif, raise him up nipple high. Stuff yourself into a uniform. We have to leave before the bomb goes off. The doctors put it in that gullible robot. lnspect the troops later. Now ask for economic cooperation. Attention! Everyone, evacuate the planet immediately! it's meatloaf night. Come, Lemon, before this dump blows up. Could you say when the bomb is exploding? Sure, my significant soldier. It'll detonate when the robot speaks a certain word.",
"It's a pain in the- Lower back! That whole region. I got to break that gate, beat up the guards… steal that chopper and rescue Bender. I did it! Wait, that's not me. Come on! We got to save Bender! You want to save him? Why? Fry, don't you recognize me? Hermes? Lee, when will I see you again? You two are good friends? be good friends. Let's see how friendly you get when you're sharing a prison cell. So it's you I've been attracted to! I've never been so happy to be beaten up by a woman.",
"Let's do it again sometime. The elders tell of a young ball like you. He bounced 3 meters in the air. Then 1. 8 meters in the air. Then he bounced 4 meters in the air. Do I make myself clear? Mr. Ambassador, our people tell the same story. These balls are making me testy! If they don't stop bouncing, I'll shove this treaty up their- Where do you shove things up a ball? Not a productive area of discussion. We're here. I followed the bouncing balls. You parachute down. My friend's life is at stake.",
"I can finally prove I'm not a coward. I already did! Thank you! At last, war has made me into a man. Gentlemen, we must put an end We've seen too many body bags and ball sacks. We can't allow bouncing of the seventh variety. No more crap! I'm catching the next pimpmobile out! But before I go, I have one thing to say. Bite my shiny metal- Stop! You can't say the next word! Up yours, chump! I said it 906 times before lunch. If you say the A-word, you'll blow this planet straight to the H-word.",

I'd rather die and kill everybody than sit here listening to these idiots! No need to bounce off the handle. That's it, I'll say it! A is for- Stop! We give in to all demands. The war is over. Our home planet is yours. All right! Wait! We're invading your planet? Correct. I guess you learned a valuable lesson.",
"Don't mess with Earth! May you bounce in peace. Get the hell off my planet! Let's reactivate him. Chumps and chumpettes! Can I say the word I love to say? Sorry, we couldn't remove it. It's stuck in there with glue or something. Great. What's the point of living if I can't say ass? I didn't blow up! I'm back in the saddle! We couldn't disarm it. We changed the word. A word you almost never say. That's using your ass. And the word? Better if you don't know. Come on, I'm not going to say it.",
"Words I never say. I know, thanks! Stop trying to destroy the world. Wait. Is it sorry? No. Funderful? Nonalcoholic? Enough already. Compassion. Shrimp toast. Antiquing? I'm all right. 1 The Cryonic Woman Giant space robot, this is Captain Fry of the USS Planet Express ship. We come in peace. We destroyed the toy spaceship. The keys to the real spaceship! Think we should? Have you seen the keys I left them onboard. I mean, what?! Relax. The ship won't go anywhere.",
"I anchored it with the unbreakable diamond tether. Hey, Fry! I'm steering with my ass! The best thing I ever saw! That was great! And no one suspects a thing! And that's how we learned our lesson. You've gone too far this time. All three of you! Look at them. Wasn't it obvious what would happen? We're very disappointed in you. I should fire you three right now… but I'm just not that cold-hearted. You're all fired! Goodbye, friends. I'll miss you. Good riddance! Now Zoidberg is the popular one! Yes! Let's all talk to Zoidberg.",
"So, Zoidberg, what's new? Oh, you know. What about money? All I've got is my first mustache… and a picture of my old girlfriend, Michelle… and that ski instructor who's just her friend. Pardon me, brother. Care to donate to the anti-mugging-you fund? We don't need to beg. We're not veterans. A robbery of Fort Knox on elephant back? Dumbest thing I ever heard. No. We can get jobs. I still have our old career chips. Our what? Career chips. Remember? They assign you the job you're best at.",
"I tried to give you one and you ran away? Then what happened? Just give me your hand. I'd like my old job counseling defrostees and assigning them careers. I was hoping you'd come back. I even saved your poster of a chimp expressing your distaste for Mondays. He lives for the weekend. Put your hand under the scanner so I can verify your career chip. Calcutta, we have a problem. Delivery boy? Here's our cryogenic counselor! Do you like Mondays? They're okay. Then we'll redecorate your office.",
"How do you feel about it helping to be crazy to work here? Welcome aboard, sir! Remember, when the tube opens, sayWelcome to the world of tomorrow! I was frozen. I think I know what defrostees want to hear. Bathroom's that way. Tell me what brings you to the future. I wanted to meet Shakespeare and I figured time was cyclical. Nope. Straight line. The probulator's done. That wasn't so bad. Oh, wait, it hasn't started yet. Okay, it's about to start. Welcome to the future, human slave! I'm not really a giant fly.",
"I'm a horrible robot! Kill all humans! He's having a heart attack! They'll find a cure in the future. We have a cure now! Good. Then you won't mind Nothing like a power nap. Oh, flies, flies and gorillas! That probulator sure knows how to please a man! So, what's for lunch? I ordered a pizza. Pizza delivery for… I. C. Wiener. Very funny. Now cough up the $12.95. After half an hour, it's free. It's only been 23 minutes. Well, I've got 33 minutes. It's only been 23 minutes, you dumb cannoli! You got a problem, I can take him.",
"Thirty five, you stupid meatball! Who should we unfreeze next? Oh, my God, it's Pauly Shore! All right! I loved you in Bio-Dome. You sure made trouble in that bubble. If it rhymes, I can cause trouble in it. Now that you're in the future, you can live in an actual bio-dome. An unattractive prospect. While researching for the role, I ran computer simulations demonstrating… that the whole concept is fundamentally flawed. Be it expressed via dome, sphere, cube.",
"So how did you wind up getting frozen? During Encino Man, my intellectual curiosity reCryogenics was peaked. I resolved to freeze the weasel. I was supposed to be unfrozen… for the 1000th anniversary screening of Jury Duty II. How come I'm not there? I woke you up early to hang out and do stuff. I'll pretend to be dying Fry? Is it really you? I don't know. Is it really you? What do you mean? Are you you, or not? Who wants to know? Oh, Fry, it is you! you were doing great.",
"You dumped me, and your life was back on track. Why'd you freeze yourself? Oh, Fry. After you left, things got worse. I got married. I'm sorry. His name was Charles. His law school was so prestigious,. was Ruth Bader Ginsburg. I put him through school by working with antisocial dogs. But soon after Charles graduated, our marriage ran into difficulties. Sorry. I turned to the one thing able to lessen my painA carnival. But a corn dog bone got lodged in the control of the Spizzler.",
"I had to ride it for 8 hours. But it did give me a chance to think. I remembered the last time I was truly happy. When I was with you. So you froze yourself to come look for me? No. I did it for a fresh start. I didn't know what happened to you. The police searched but your parents felt it was a waste of money. Same reason they kept me out of school. No one cared I was gone?

"Now people like art that's tattooed on fat guys. I'm on loan from the Louvre. Please, professor. We deserve another chance. And if you won't give me another chance, perhaps you'd give one to… Og, gorilla emperor of Earth! Sorry, Og. But I've got a new crew. How was your delivery to Fantasy Planet… where everyone's fantasies Great! Organized! For one beautiful night, I knew what it was to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. Everything's running smoothly. With Fry fired, I can leave my jigsaw puzzles out.",
"He won't eat the pieces. Forget about Fry. Hire us back. He'll never know. Hey, Fry! So, as Leela was saying, Fry can go shove a big, old. I'm glad you're all here. Here's my ex-girlfriend of the past This is Bender. The professor. Hermes and Amy. And this is Dr. Zoidberg. Dating your ex, Fry? Have you lost all self-respect? It can end badly. Kids, a house. Home invasion by an old roommate. It's different now. She was demanding and possessive. Now she wants me to do stuff, be with her.",
"There you go, dearies. It's a relief to meet you, Amy. It's hard adjusting to all the strange stuff of the future. I'm from Mars. I feel so out of place. I don't understand why Fry fits in so well. Because he didn't in your time. True. But I used to fit in really well. Then good luck, sister. Don't take this the wrong way. Your friends are freaks. Great, huh? I don't belong. I don't know anyone. I can't find vanishing cream that won't make me really vanish. I don't have a job.",
"I'm supposed to assign you one. I'll get your career chip installed. Hold out your palm. It's like getting your hand pierced. This world is horrible. Let's go where all we have is each other. Romantic. I'll tell Bender to meet us there. It's not a there. It's a then. The future. I thought you meant a motel where I love you. Don't you love me? Sure. To the extent a man can love a woman. But this is a big step. Why must you analyze everything with your relentless logic? Nothing matters but our love.",
"You're right. Let's do this now and never regret it. Michelle, I don't regret this. But I rue and lament it. The year 4000 is disappointing. I miss 3000 when brains flew through space and people ate lasers. It's not so bad. Fate brought us together and brought us here. You brought us here. Whine some more. It's really attractive. Now, build us a shelter. Fine. Everything else sucks. At least we'll have a nice place to live. There! You expect me to live in a hole? It'd be deeper, but I'm standing on a gopher.",
"We're saved! I'm Butch, leader of this place! I took your hole. You can't do nothing about it! Sir, we have nowhere to go. Could we please join your society? All right. But no interfering with our grand works. Butch runs a good civilization. I'll enjoy serving under him. You know your problem? You're not ambitious. What do I need, ulcers? I want power. I'm tired of the chief's girlfriend… Iording it over me with her fancy coyote hide. All right. If it'll make you happy, I'll overthrow society.",
"On what grounds do you challenge my authority? I'm older. I can beat you up. He's got arm hair. All right, Grandpa. There's only one way to settle this. Death rolling. It's like skateboarding. Except half the time, someone dies. So it's safer than skateboarding. Last one holding the bandanna is the new leader. My mother always said you were a loser. Now go prove her wrong! My knee! I scraped it! Poor little guy. I won! I'm the new chief! I'm the tallest and I weigh the most! Hand it over, you giant idiot! Butch, your mom's here! Ah, man! Come on, kids! You're late for Hebrew school! I don't wanna go.",
"Every Monday and Wednesday's the same thing. This post-apocalyptic wasteland is very confusing. Seriously, I'm weirded out. That's because you're a loser. You were a loser in the year 2000, you're a loser in the year 4000. But in 3000, I had it all. Friends, a low-paying job, a bed in a robot's closet! I envied no man! But you wrecked everything! Quit standing up for yourself, Fry! Back at the hole, we'll have a boring talk about our relationship! Oh, yeah? Listen to this! I'm leaving you.",
"There must be people somewhere. Yes! Footprints! And handprints? But what's happening? Fry, thank God we found you! What are you guys doing in the year 4000? It's not 4000. You were only frozen for two days. I broke your bed. You were in Pauly Shore's tube. They delivered it to his movie screening. They noticed you weren't him and threw you out. So these aren't the decaying ruins of New York in 4000? You wish. You're in Los Angeles! But there were kids with guns. Exactly. You're in L.",
"Everyone shoots at each other. There's no sign of civilization. Stop with the social commentary. The people are phony. No one reads. Everything has cilantro on it. It's not working out, Fry. Tis better to have loved and lost, n'est-ce pas? I've had it with women. I'm gonna concentrate on my career. Can I have my job back? I've forgotten why I even fired you. He destroyed your business and all your possessions. Oh, that's right. Get lost! SDI Media Group Parasites Lost Breaker, breaker, this is the Duck.",
"You wanna back off them hogs? Ten-four. About five miles or so. Ten, roger. I'd better check the fluid levels. We're okay on Coke syrup. Oh, man, come on! Coming through! What's that black cracker? You're eating a sandwich from a men's room? What's the worst thing that could happen? It's like a party in my mouth, and everyone's throwing up. Look. One of them things like on our mud flaps. I'm gonna put my moves on her. Jerk! No one hoots at my captain unless they wanna go to the next level.",
"Fry, I'd rather not dignify them with an ass-whipping. and freaky, in that order. she wanted to make love with you? I got five minutes. She looks pretty good for a truck-stop chick. You take that back! She does not look good for a truck-stop chick! You're right, she don't got enough meat for me. She's got more meat than a cow. Meat than a cow! I can't please Leela no matter what I do. I just want her to like me. Well, there's always hope. the plasma fusion boiler. Who are you? Scruffy.",
"A janitor. Why aren't you fixing the boiler? Schedule conflict. There, fixed forever. Scruffy's gonna die Oh, marmalade. Oh, the hypochondriac's back. My lead pipe hurts a little. That's normal. Next. Did you eat anything unusual recently? What about that bathroom egg salad? I've had better. Egg salad? Zoidberg will have to examine your gastrointestinal tract. Come, everyone. Give Fry some privacy. If you can't see well enough, there'll be a close-up on this video screen. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.",
"Guess again. Gross! Go, man, go. Watch for any subtle irregularity in Fry's bowel. It's gorgeous. Worms? Puke-a-tronic! So the eggs in that sandwich were. Correct! Worm eggs. And the mayonnaise wasn't too fresh either. It's nauseating, man. Is there no way to get rid of the disgusting maggots? Only one. We'll have to travel deep inside Fry… in this! Shotgun! Shotgun! In each gastro-survival kit is a rain slicker, a disposable fun camera… and something to protect you against bacteriaa harpoon.",
"Micro-droids? Can't you just shrink us? No. That would require extremely tiny atoms. Have you priced those lately? I'm not made of money. Leave me alone! Me next! Your net suits will let you experience Fry's worm-infested bowels… as if you were actually wriggling through them. There's no part of that sentence I didn't like. Is everyone present? Definitely. Here's the plan. We enter the ear, drip down the back of the throat… and make for the bowel. There, we'll irritate the splenic ganglion.",
"I'll tell Fry to wash out his ear. No! Fry can't know about the mission. If he finds out, the worms will defend themselves. They know everything he knows. Like how to make ice-cream soup? Leela! Your role is to distract Fry. Can do! Leela, you should really try a facial scrub for your pores. Look, a starling! Be very quiet. We're in the ear. Okay, professor. What if we go for a walk, possibly, Let's go where he won't put his finger.",
"What are they doing to Fry's brain? They're giving it a tune-up. A quick glance suggests they've doubled his thinking power. My God! Soon he'll be smarter than Cher! Ah, the scent of a rose. Curious how aromatic hydrocarbons… can evoke deep emotions. For you. And you expressed it without spewing crumbs at me. Brace yourselves. We're entering the interior of Fry's nose. We're at finger alert five! Let's just pray nothing stimulates his smell receptors. Quick! We can escape through that capillary into the sinus.",
"Usually you don't know a thing about human anatomy. I learned it from a decongestant commercial Soothing action. Where are we, the ass? The heart. Better known as the love muscle. We should be safe so long as nothing makes it beat faster. Abandon ship! Set course for that cholesterol-encrusted valve. It's good cholesterol, but it spreads like bad cholesterol. They're Jazzercising Fry's muscles. He'll be as strong and flexible as Gumby and Hercules combined. Gum-ercules?! I love that guy.",
"It's that jerk from the truck stop. Let's go blend in with those pimps. I don't think so. Sir, you owe this lady an apology. Fry, no! He's bulging with I got your apologies right here. Sorry, ma'am. I've learned a lesson about not ogling cans I won't forget. Scenic gateway to the bowel. Abandon ship! No. Don't give up now. We're close to the pyloric sphincter. There it is, the stately capitol of Fry's bowel. A heavily-guarded fortress surrounding the splenic ganglion. I've heard of that.",
"If we can stimulate it, the bowel will convulse, expelling the worms. But what about the worms in other areas? This is gonna be one hell of a bowel movement. He'll be lucky to have bones left. All right, let's mush some worms! Worms to battle stations! I had a great time. The flowers, the puddle, the way you hurt that guy. But can I axe you something? There's something I've wanted But when I try, my mouth feels like it's stuffed with peanut butter. Is it about Bender? No, it's about you and me.",
"And Bender? Bender's not involved. Leela. But only recently have I been able to articulate my thoughts. And I always have. Fry, that's the sweetest, most wonderful. Wait! Recently? Like since you ate that sandwich? Yeah. I don't know why, but my life really turned around that day. Stay here. Freshen your naugateena? Please, I need something The nerve is through here. Where's Zoidberg? You'll never guess where I've been. One! Two! Three! There it is. The pelvic splenic ganglion.",
"Tickle it, then get ready for the ride of your lives. Don't even think about it. Leela! You're in time to help. If we don't get rid of the worms now, they'll burrow so deep… not even Hermes' famous jerk prunes could dislodge them. I call it Caribbean Drano. Fry will be stuck with worms forever. Perfect. Leela, you ignorant dope! Now the worms will be in Fry forever. Maybe Fry is better off with worms. If anyone wants to tell me what's going on, I'll be in the lounge. Of all the parasites I've had, these worms are among.",
"They are the best! How can I repay you for saving them? I'll think of something. Hello, what's all this, then? Apartment 1 I. It's a little under-furnished. I'm thinking of having a window installed. The view's perfect already. That's the corniest thing I've ever heard. Let me show you the bedroom. In a minute. A holophonor? Only a few people can play that, and they're not very good. They don't have you to inspire them. I don't have words to say how wonderful you are. I haven't felt this happy since double-soup Tuesday.",
"With you, every day Oh, Fry, I love what you've become. There's something I have to find out. Who controls this bowel? Who wants to know? I am the lord mayor of Cologne! You mean colon? State your business. Have you ever been in love? I thought I was once. But then I remembered we reproduce with spore clouds. A wonderful girl loves me, but I need to know if it's me she loves… or just what you worms. I'm asking you to leave. Listen, you! I was born here. I raised a cloud of children here.",
"My ancestors came here on the sandwich. No one can make me leave! Get out or the brain gets it! He's bluffing! He wouldn't willingly make himself an idiot. Obviously you've never been in love. Now, the hand-eye coordination lobe. You've damaged your brain… but no more than a few drinks or five minutes on a cell phone. I was working my way toward the control center of the heart and lungs. Wait a minute, man. I hope Satan has a nice colon, because that's where you're going. Stop! We'll leave.",
"But one day you'll be eating a fast-food burger… and boom! You'll be crawling with us again. Ever wonder what makes Fry? I missed you. Did you find out what you needed to find out? I'm about to. Let me play for you. You don't have to. I'm still seduced from before. Please. It's important to me. What does that mean? I don't know. I got nervous and started thinking about neck bolts. Wow, did you see that vase break? What's happened to you? I got rid of the worms. I needed to know who you loved.",
"Well, which of you wrote that sonnet? I did! I think. It was probably 50-50. But that's how I really felt, I swear. I don't know. Let me try to be romantic on my own. back rub just like I used to give Amy. Sorry you struck out. If it's any consolation, my life is great. Well, at least I learned There you go! Good night. I gotta get up early to go parasailing with movie stars. 1 Amazon Women in the Mood People, we got a problem. Nibbler's been coughing up hairballs.",
"So has Fry. What's the big deal? We all love Nibbler, so it's only fair that we all clean up together. Still, I propose we make Zoidberg do it. All in favor? All abstaining? Dr. Zoidberg, are you okay? Laughing, singing, begging for scraps. And now this! Why with all the crying? So, that's where I left my shell. I didn't know it came off. It was getting a little cramped, so I molted, why not? The fresh air feels good. Stop doing that! So long. I'm off to toss this old shell in the dumpster.",
"Maybe pick up the potato chips Amy didn't finish. Those were toenail clippings. Hey, that's my cell phone! Did you swallow your phone again? Some guy's been calling and hanging up 1 0 times a day for a year. Men who call too much are the worst, I bet. I wish a decent guy would call me. too terrified to answer the phone. Hello? Is anyone there? Why must I be such a coward? I'm off to the men's room, and I need an attendant. Oh, I'm sorry. You're crying like a woman. I see myself as a father figure to some of my more pathetic men.",
"Kif, old friend, let's rap. Well, I'm in love with this girl. Oh, that's rich! Go on. I met her a year ago… escaping from that cruise ship you piloted into a black hole. Yes, it was in all the papers. I've finished talking. Belay that remark! Your Amy knows my Leela? I have formed an idea. I want to negotiate a double date. You and me, Kif and Amy. Forget it! Then let the negotiations begin. I propose we go out on 1 0 dates. How about zero? Nine. Zero. Seven? Eight? who ever liked me.",
"Five, and that's my final offer. Four! One. We'll meet you for part of dinner and half of a movie. Sir? I don't go out on many dates. What if I don't know what to say? Here's my book of pickup lines. Say as many as you can, as fast as you can. Don't stop. I'll just give her these flowers. Wrong, wrong, wrong. And what's that? Candy? Candy's for dorks. Give me that. Hello, beautiful. I got these for you. Thanks. one disturbingly erotic date. A bottle of wine. And oysters on the half-shell.",
"Quarter-shell. And I'd like. He's not hungry. It's expensive. I'd like two steaks, and the ladies will have sensual salads… with low-cal sensual dressing. Thank you. Kif, you haven't said a word all night. Because I was really hoping we could talk and stuff… would you take your pants off and dance?Lieutenant Kroker! I find the most erotic part of a woman is the boobies. This half-date is entirely over. Amy? Conference. Is there nothing we can do? There's one way into a woman's heart and parts beyond.",
"I speak, of course, of karaoke. My years in the Duke Boys' Chorus will not have been in vain. All right, enough lipstick. Let's storm out. Oh, that's so emotional! Amateur hour's over. The Velour Fog. Give us a break. He sickens me! We're going home. No need. There's not a restaurant built I can't fly. Where to, ladies? Please, sir. Let's just divide up the check, and. Let's see what this eatery can do. but she handles like a bistro. She's out of control! You win again, gravity! Look! My new shell catalog! So, let's try some on, already! Hey, gringos, here comes El Zoido to ruin your drinking water! I'm Mexican, and I find that offensive! You Latins are so hot-blooded.",
"This one's like a summer guy! The Planet Express health plan only covers one kind of replacement shell. I can't believe Leela and Amy aren't back. I'm gonna call the restaurant. The number you have dialed has crashed into a planet. We gotta go rescue them! I don't know. Bender, think of the seńoritas! Vámonos! It's always a line with you. What planet is this? This whole sector is uncharted. It is not. You lost the chart. Well, nothing to do but repopulate the human race, just me and you.",
"And maybe you. Me hear people, but me not see. Everybody make mistake. I usually don't say this… but you are the most beautiful trio of gigantic ladies I've ever seen. I find the most erotic part of a woman is the boo. Oh, no. Any sign of Leela or Amy? I don't know, but it might have something to do with this. Oh, your God! All right. Here's the plan. What kind of moronic plan is that? Women go free. Men stay in chains. We take them to our leader. She know what do. A female leader? Fry, shut up! Yes, captain.",
"This capital city, planet Amazonia. Where are all the men? Men die out many year ago. They were probably nagged to death. Are you with me, fellas? Here stadium, where women No can dunk, but good fundamentals. That more fun to watch. Oh, God, you're killing me. God, you're killing me! This our comedy club. Humor different here.

You obey a big computer? Yes. It appeared at time men die out. Why did you make it your leader? It different kind of politician. Not beltway insider. Fem-puter, we bring offering of bath beads and scented soaps. Your gift pleases Fem-puter. Why are there men on her planet?! It was an accident.",
"That does not fem-pute. Fem-puter will return after deciding your punishment! I'm through making fun of women. I want them to help me. Should we do something? There's no hurry. Yes. A little tighter. Tighter. Perhaps a hard spanking is in order? Too hard! Men strange. You have them? I'm afraid so. What they for? You mean snu-snu! We hear tell men used for snu-snu. All we have go on are ancient legend and subscription to Cosmo. FYI, I could be used for snu-snu. Silence! You want die like last men visit Amazonia? Crushed pelvises.",
"Thank you, Lord in heaven! After lengthy fem-putations, I have decided the fate of the men. Fem-puter sentences them to death… by snu-snu! What are you, gay? Death to the men! Death by snu-snu! But the snu-snu part will be good. Baby, it'll blow your mind. Be reasonable. Sure, men are annoying, and they wreck their planets. But these men are sort of my friends. They don't deserve to die. Perhaps men are not as evil as Fem-puter thinks. They make fun women's basketball. What?! Did you explain how good fundamentals make up.",
"The men must die! Too true, Fem-puter. You're so wise. Kill'em all. Good riddance. Did I mention I'm not a man? I'm a manbot. Understandable mistake. You can let me down. He big jerk like man. Sure, but check the crotch. Nothing. Very well. Release him. As for the others, take them to the snu-snu chambers. I never thought I'd die like this, but I'd always really hoped. The Amazonians will be divided into three groups. The one called Zapp will be snu-snu'd by the large women.",
"He that is designated Fry will be snu-snu'd by the petite women. And Kif, as the most attractive male… will be snu-snu'd by the most beautiful women of Amazonia. Then the large women. Then the petite women. Then the large women again. Initiate snu-snu! Before I die, I have to tell you I didn't mean to say those awful things. They were all Zapp's idea. Really? Honest and true? Yes. And that person calling and hanging up was me. I was just too nervous to say hello It Og's first time.",
"Be gentle! We've got to do something. You can interface with the fem-puter and reprogram it. Maybe you can interface with my ass. By biting it! All right, I'll go. How Tonk look? Tonk look good. Me fat. No, you look good. Tonk fat. Intruder! Stay away from the mighty Fem-puter! Guards! Time to override the CPU and reprogram this fem-puter. Cease hitting Fem-puter. You're no fem-puter, you're a fembot. It's true. I disguised myself so I could rule the Amazonians. I came here from a faraway planet.",
"A planet ruled by a chauvinistic man-puter that was really a manbot. Have you any idea how it feels. in a manbot's man-puter's world? And now, meddling manbot, there's the question of what to do with you. We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. It time snu-snu! Can't we just cuddle? We can't wait for Bender. It's time for a woman's touch. Me next snu-snu! Out me way! Where go beautiful man? Me want snu-snu! My hero. Me not get snu-snu. Get him! Mighty Fem-puter!

Come on, give me some of that. That's how I got my new shell. It looks just like the one I threw out. I found it in the same dumpster, but this one had a live raccoon in it. Pretty good story, eh? Stick to someone else, you windy barnacle! was only resolved… when a manbot and a fembot realized they loved each other.",
"I'm not here. All I know is, this gold says that was the best mission ever. It sure was. I had snu-snu. What do you want to do now?1 Bendless Love Guidance system? Online. Present. Dark-matter indicator? Making a noise. All systems operational. Let's rock. Gentlemen, I've completed my report on the crash. I'm not reading that! Summarize it in one word. This is a normal L-unit. Without it, space travel is the dream of a madman. It's an important unit. And this, my friends, is the L-unit I just removed from the ship.",
"That's not an L! Unless you count lowercase. You know we don't! Whoever did this was strong. This is 340 pounds of Tonka-tough steel. But, instead, it looks like thisAnd by that,I mean thisanother mystery on our hands. I'd better make a chart of suspects. I'll draw a line with my straightedge. Sweet lamprey of Santa Fe! My edge has been bent! My javelin too! It's ruined! Now we'll never beat Jupiter State! My Slinky! My cuddly little pet Slinky! Even the professor's been bent. Thank you for your sympathy, talking square of linoleum.",
"That's fine. What did you do to the professor? I bent him. It's Bender! A bunch of stuff gets bent, so it must be the robot designed for bending. I know, we'll check last night's surveillance tapes. You've seen me naked? Last night's tape. It was right next to Bathroom Bloopers Four. See? Nothing! I told you, losers! Wait, there on the screen! It's that guy you are! I'm sleepwalking! We've got robots on the ceiling. You weren't sleepwalking, you were sleep-bending. On the other hand, it's not surprising.",
"After all, I've been bending since the day I was built. I was born on an assembly line in the bad part of Tijuana. Hooray! I graduated! Time to bend around Europe for a few months, then get a job bending. You remember your birth? It was only four years ago. You're only four years old? Precocious little scamp, ain't I? Bender must have a need to bend that's not satisfied by his lifestyle. He can't stay. He's a menace to every straight person in the company. Go satisfy your bend-lust. And don't you come back to work until you do! No more bending, no more work Give us a raise, you big fat jerk Nevers! Yo! The mafia supports you! But don't tell no one! Spread the word! As duly elected mobsters of this union.",
"It's our duty to support the struggle of these slobs. What if management is intragnizent? In context, it's clear what you mean. In that case, Clamps may have a surprise for them. Aw, no! A strike? Now I'll never get to bend anything! Oh, woe is Bender! Management refused to switch casual Friday to Monday. They hire scabs at 1 0 times our wage! Ten times normal wage! I'll give those jerks what for! Welcomes aboard, scab. Great to be here. I'll introduces you to your scab coworkers you'll be scabbing with.",
"This here's our scab foreman. Bender? Sorry you got sent to that South American Turkish prison instead of me. You bastard! They treated me like an animal! And that's what I became! No, you're all right. And here's another scab what also works here, Angleene. Hey, you guys want to move that things? Give us a raise, you big fat jerk Nevers! Hi, Angleene. What you up to? Making hangers. Counselor said I had a knack for it. So, I was wondering if. You know, it's cool if not, but. What are you doing after work? Me too.",
"Man, we have a lot in common, huh? Well, we are made of virtually identical components. Are you sure? Maybe I should peek at your access panel. Hey, according to the Scab Handbook, that's inappropriate banter. And that's just There, little friend. Good as new. What an exquisite day! That azure sky. The verdant treetops. Those delightful birds with their chirp, chirp and their tweet, tweet, splat. I've never seen you so cheerful. What's wrong with you? Seeing things from a new perspective has reminded me of life's beauty.",
"Perhaps my posture is causing blood to pool in the back of my brain… resulting in a mild delirium. By the way, you have a dime up your nose. I wish. It's a nickel. Union forever! Lousy scabs! They can't do those things! Et cetera! I bet watching me bend girders turns your legs rubbery. My legs are made of rubber. And anyway, I am just as strong as you are, Mac. Oh, yeah? Prove it. Here. Let me help you. My new bent outlook has completely re-energized me. I'm even dating a young, Brazilian, retired actress.",
"Some say I'm robbing the cradle, but I say she's robbing the grave. Howdy, doodies! What's new? I was regaling your former coworkers with a tale of bedroom antics. Big whoop, no one cares. I got Bender-related news. I'm in love. And I'm taking all my friends out to celebrate. Let's get liquored up! Hey, look at this crowd. You guys gotta try the pasta. It's got a nice profit margin. Bam! So, special occasion tonight? You'll never guess what's happened! I've met the most dynamite lady-bot.",
"Hey, that's terrific! To celebrate, I'm gonna stick seven copies of my book on your bill. Bless you, sir. So, Bender, tell us about this new girlfriend of yours. I intend to, through the lost art of the toast. To Angleene. She's got it all. Looks, charm and the love of a fabulous bending robot. She sure does. Careful, that's a week old. I finally meet a nice girl, with legs that don't quit… and that jerk Flexo steals her away? It's time to kick some shiny, You degenerate hussy! I'm disappointed in you too, Angleene! Bender, it's not what you think! God, then it's worse than I think! Now look, there is no reason Flexo and I are divorced.",
"We're just having dinner to stay friends. I knew that. What I'm outraged by is your choice of wine! Really, it's the steward's fault. Excellent choice, sir. That Flexo, why, I'm knocking him on his butt. I can't believe this. Obsessing won't help, Bender. Take a lean back and enjoy life. My fembot may be in love with another manbot. Well, talk to her. Tell her your feelings in an honest way. Either that, or be a man. I've constructed an elaborate lie. I'll call Angleene, pretend to be Flexo, arrange a date.",
"Show up as him and catch her two-timing me with myself. That's thinking like a man. Since when do you go to bars on work nights? It's not like you. Nonsense. It's exactly like me. Flexo, the fun-loving love machine I'll have a fuzzy navel. She'll have the girliest drink in the house. Two fuzzy navels coming up. I hope they can change a fortune. Get an eye-load of that scab with the beard flashing his filthy scab money. It's an insult, boss. That cash should be slushing my fund and kicks-ing my back.",
"I'm greasing up my whoozits! a couple more times. You're looking good. Quit making googly eyes. I'm in love with Bender. Bender? That walking wuss factory? He may be a walking factory, but he is no wuss. You and me are through. I told you when I divorced you. Going through a divorce, tell me that didn't bring us closer. Care to dance? You know I love dancing, In that case, it's something I've always wanted to make up to you. Hey, Scratch-Mo! Drop me and the lady some rump-rattling beats.",
"I'd hoped by the second time he flashed cash, my rage would subside. Sadly, that has not happened. You used to be so inflexible, Flexo. You've really loosened up. I recently upgraded my funk card. Come on! All right! Hit me! Come on, now! What's new? Flexo, what's going on? The moral of the story isIf you want it to stay sunk, tie a weight to it! Yeah! You always were a kick in the teeth, man. Aw, shucks, thunder-buns. You make me feel like a million volts. Flexo, I'm starting to remember why I fell for you in the first place.",
"So she's falling for Flexo, eh? I'd better seduce her a little more just to be sure. to my trailer. I'll walk you out. A true gentleman tends to his date's every need. Tiparillo? Here you are, my lad. Bring the lady's car around in the finest way possible. He's flashing his cash again. How many times is that? Three! That's the necessary number of times. That scab's gonna have an on-the-job accident. Don-bot, I don't think we should rely on an accident happening. Let's kill him ourselves.",
"Well, good night. I had a great time. How about a lift? To your place? You felt something for me tonight. And by me, I mean Flexo. Hey, look. I had fun, but. Huh? Bender, you tricked me! That's right, baby! I ain't your lover-boy, Flexo, You even love anybody pretending to be him! Maybe I love you no matter who you're pretending to be! or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action nowKill Flexo! Thanks, I appreciate that. Nah, I'm joshing you. That was annoying.",
"You call yourself divorced? You're mocking one of our oldest institutions! Give the word and I'll drop this unbendable girder. Clamp-ka-bamp! Only kill the one with the beard. That other scab, we got nothing against. Please stop! I'm not worth it! Probably not! But I love you, and I'm gonna kick his ass till I win you back! Flexo, are you okay? Yeah. Never better. I'm yanking your chain. I'm dying. You can't die! Bender showed me that I love you. I know, and I care for you too. But I could never love anyone as much as you made me realize I love Flexo! I love you so much, I want you to be happy, no matter what.",
"What are you saying? I'm saying… I've got an unbendable girder to bend. You can't bend it. It's unbendable! I don't know anything about lifting, so that just leaves us the one option. Thanks. Another year under that and I'd have been a goner. I'll always remember this, Bender. Jerk. Flexo and Angleene had sex right on the factory floor? You got bending out of your system. I won't be up to bending again for a long, long time. Perhaps it's your outlook that needs a bend.",
"We're sick of your upbeat attitude. Nonsense. It's just like in the song I wroteWe all need a new angle on life I try to get out, but they keep pulling me back in! Wangle a new dangle on life No, the other way! I like him better this way. I'm sad now. It's fine. 1 The Day the Earth Stood Stupid Is Nibbler stoked for the show? He ought to be, with all the training. Nibbler, roll over and you get a ham. Roll over. Roll over for the ham.",
"You are so adorable. Who wants a ham? Zooka barooka! First prize is $500 and a year's supply of dog food! Five hundred dollars, you say? That dog's gonna be hard to beat. One sheep, two sheep… three sheep. But our real competition is the Hypno-Toad. Your turn, Nibbler. Herd those sheep! Come on, Nibbler! I have a late entry. My hard-shelled whooping terrier, Mr. Zoidberg. Faster! Faster! Suck in that gut! You wanna be spayed? Silence, you cur! Puff out that brisket! I should be weeping! I'm not weeping! I love these things.",
"Shake paws, Nibbler. Come on, shake. He might be a little hungry. Usually, he's had more ham by now. Shake! Third prize, a party-sized keg of guinea pigs, goes to. and his owner, Fluffers. Second prize, this lovely afghan, made from an Afghan, goes to… Bender and his whooping terrier! Second place? That's a fancy word for losing! You didn't stick your landing! Forgive me, my friend. Never! And before we announce the winner, we have a special award for… Ms. Leela and her mystery pet, Nibbler! Me? Award? That's the eloquence you'd expect from the owner of.",
"Dumbest Pet in Show! And the grand prize winnerThe Hypno-Toad! All glory to the Hypno-Toad! Ah, maybe they're right. Maybe Nibbler is dumb. Don't listen to them. People said I was dumb, but I proved them. Good news. We were supposed to make a delivery to the planet Tweenis 1 2. But it's been completely destroyed. Why is that good news? They paid in advance. This is mighty strange. First, Space Rome collapsed. Then, Don Martin 3 went caflooie. And now Tweenis 1 2. This planet is next.",
"That's Earth. The planet we live on? What's got into him? He's twitching like Zoidberg when you say food. What, now? No! Nibbler, come back! Too bad Nibbler's not around. I'll have to eat this raw ham myself. Nibbler? Nibbler, you're scaring me. Nibbler?! Am I going crazy? Have my years of hedonism Nibbler, help! Don't leave me here! Nibbler? Could you scooch Help me! My heart stopped! You don't have one. You're a robot. Sure. Right. Robot. Oh, Fry! My skin's all dry and clanky. Well, yeah.",
"Robots are made of metal. Am I a robot? I don't get this scam. You already have my power of attorney. Fry! My skin! I'm a genius! Why is everyone acting so weird? Zoidbee want balloon! Want balloon now! Zoidbee want go outside! Oh, I just let you back in! Unbelievable! I thought you were a furry little moron. But here you are flying an adorable spaceship! If only you could talk. Wait! I understood that! You're transmitting your thoughts directly to my brain? You say those awful flying brains are making everyone on Earth stupid? Oh, stupider.",
"And you say we're headed for your home planet… where you've lived since the beginning of the universe? So, how did the universe begin? Then the meaning of existence. ? So every religion is wrong. Some bad things happened. One bad thing was… a train got crashed. Wanna see? People won't be late, though. The governor saidI'm sending in more trains. Wait for me! Morbo can't understand his Teleprompter. How do you say the letter that looks like a man with a hat? Hello, little man.",
"I will destroy you! Even the news monster is acting strange. What to do? I know! Let's play the lottery! Let's buy Internet stock! On margin! Zoidbee wanna buy on margin! Look at me! I'm invisible! I know what's going on! Hey! Let's all join the Reform Party! Welcome back, ambassador to Earth, homeworld of the pizza bagel. I bear many receipts for reimbursement. The four welcomes to you as well, Leela. We shall appear to be speaking your language. Do not be afraid, child. I'm not afraid.",
"So, your real name is Lord Nibbler? It is for your sake. By the time you pronounce one letter of my name… a trillion cosmoses would sink into eternal night. Oh, you're all so cute. No, we are an ancient, powerful race. Behold. When the universe was forged in the big bang… our mighty race was already 1 7 years old. For the first millisecond, things were okay. But there arose a terrible enemy, the Brain Spawn. Ever since, we have waged unceasing war against these dreadful.",
"Lunch is ready. Then let the feast of 1 000 hams begin! Why are these Brain Spawn attacking Earth? They hate all consciousness. Thoughts screech at them like the forced laughs of movie patrons. Thus, they travel… making everyone stupid in order They're flying televisions! And even we are powerless to stop them, fearsome though we are. There is one being who can resist. A child of destiny whose bizarre brain waves make him immune to their attack. He is the hope of the universe.",
"The fate of your world, perhaps all worlds, rests in his special mind. Now, when you say special. Attention New New Yorkers! Stop acting so stupid! Fleet holding at perimeter of Moron Zone, formerly known as Earth. Why would Fry be immune? Because he doesn't shower? They suppress intelligence by attacking delta brain waves. Every animal and robot generates this wave, as do certain trees. Fry, however, does not. Somehow, he has cobbled random brain waves into a working mind. Like a carpet-remnant prom dress.",
"Like your prom dress. The Brain Spawn are commanded by a brain with a gooey center of pure hate. Only Fry, with his superior, yet inferior mind, can approach it. We will do the rest. You can count on me. On Earth, you will be too stupid. That's why we wrote it down for you. We also prepared a bag lunch and mittens. Time to reeducate you dunces. We'll start with presidents. This was our first president, George Washington. Let's review. Who was our first president? A pickle jar? Thomas Jefferson? Leela! I've been so worried! Are you a bonehead?",
"You're going a mile a minute. This. you for this! Thanks! Fire hot! The professie will help. Fire indeed hot. Oh, Chester A. Arthur fall down. Brain. Brain make people dumb. No, Leela. Brain make people smart. You go fight biggest brain. Even bigger than those? Where is it? I don't know. A giant brain is basically a giant nerd. And where would a giant nerd be? The library! Pathetic human race. Arranging knowledge by category made it easier to absorb.",
"Dewey, you fool, your decimal system has played right into my hands. What do you want? I'm here to kick your ass! Wishful thinking. We have long since evolved beyond the need for asses. Odd. My stupefaction field is having no effect on you. That's right! You'll find a little knowledge is a dangerous thing! Better think of a new plan. Come on, think. Thinking. Thinking. Thinking hurts him! Maybe I can think of a way to use that. Prepare to be thought at! I can't think of anything.",
"Gotta find something. Hardy Boys? Too easy. Nancy Drew? Too hard. Perfect! Bonfire of the Vanities! No! It's unbearable! They're weakening. Nibblonians to Nibble stations. Prepare Cuddle Bug for deployment. Sometimes I fear we are cute. Oh, niggle-snooch. Take that! This one I don't understand. But take this one! You have not won yet. to a mental realm… and I shall take you there and imprison you forever! Where are we? A gold doubloon to the man who first spies the white whale.",
"Big whale over there. I saw it first. Wait! That no white whale! It gray thinkie whale! Farewell! You will all be trapped in this dense symbolist tome forever! Follow him! It's our only way out! Have you seen a giant brain? Yep. I let him help with the fence. Tom Sawyer, you tricked me. This is less fun than previously indicated. Let this corny slice of Americana be your tomb for all eternity. Come on! Mr. Fry? Mama says you're quite the oddity. A bachelor at your age. I'm an oddity? Wait till.",
"The most eligible landowner in all Hartfordshire, Mr. Brainley. I'm a gigantic brain! Most ungentlemanlike. What news have you of the London season? Hey, think fast! I always think fast. The whale! He be white now! I've got an idea. Stay here with Queequeg. Is there a Mrs. Queequeg? Yes! I'm free! All right, brain! Get ready for some electroshock treatment! Fry, don't die! Wake up! Leela cried as Fry lay dead under the heavy bookcase. The Big Brain laughed in triumph. Then, for no reason, he left Earth forever.",
"The End. There! Now he's trapped in my book, full of plot holes and spelling errors. The Big Brain am winning again! I am the greetest! Now I am leaving Earth for no raisin! The Big Brain is defeated. Let what must be done, be done. Me. feel. a bit better in cognitive faculties. And it's all thanks to the books at my local library. And so, life returned to normal. Or as normal as it gets on this dirtball inhabited by psychotic apes. The people of Earth had no memory of what had transpired.",
"Except Fry. And no one believed him or cared what he had to say. I returned to my post, ever-vigilant, lest Earth again come under attack. And when that day comes, Time for a diapie change. End transmission. 1 That's Lobstertainment So I says, Super Collider? I just met her. And then they built the Super Collider. Thank you. You've been great. Humorbot 5. 0, ladies and gentlemen. Our next standup's a veteran of four comedy traffic schools. Give it way up for Bobcat Zoidberg! All right! All right! Earth.",
"What a planet. On Earth, you enjoy eating a tasty clam. On my planet, clams enjoy eating a tasty you! Maybe I'm not loud enough. On Earth, everybody is looking for a squid! On my planet. So these three parasitic worms bore into a human's head. And they walk up to the bar and then. Wait! Stop! I've got more! My whole life I worked on that act. And they hated it. You're a crazy lobster doctor! You shouldn't be a comedian! But comedy is in my valves. My Uncle Harold was a big star back in the era of silent holograms.",
"Your uncle was Harold Zoid? This I cannot deny. Why, I've been a fan since back when my hips were made of bone! As it happens, I still have some of my original 78s. He's a lot funnier than you could ever be. Maybe, but perhaps if I wrote him and asked for a few hundred pointers. This letter has to be very personal, so I'm writing it in my own ink. Dear Uncle Zoid, Greetings from your nephew. Norm and Sam and Sadie's boy? Remember? Now I'm the most important doctor at the company where I work.",
"But my life is bereft of laughter. I beg of you, Mr. Funny Uncle. Teach me the comedy business. Sincerely, Zoidberg. Isn't that nice? What's that scribble-di-gook? It's a letter from my rich nephew. Yeah, you'd better run! Dear Rich Doctor Nephew, I can help you be funny. The first funny thing. is put your money in check form and come to Hollywood. Sincerely, Harold Zoid. P. cashier's check. Did you hear that? I'm going to Hollywood! I must warn you… there's no refund if you get discovered and leave the tour.",
"I'm kidding. That never happens. Now, to your right, you'll see Fox uses searchlights to blind pilots… then film the resulting plane crashes… you'll see the home of Mel Gibson, star of the hit film Bravehead. Do we have any fans of Calculon… star of the robot soap All My Circuits? I am! Me! Bender is! Then you'll want to get a close look at his Bel Air home. Are you my hot-water heater? We met once. Remember? Absolutely not. Remember I was bugging you a lot? You remember, right? Look, I'm programmed to be very busy.",
"Unless you can heat water to 21 2 degrees, I'm not interested. Have you got an extra GOTO 1 0 line? I don't need a Bender. That was the other guy. My name's Boiler. Nice work, Boiler. Thanks. And call me Bender. That's where I'm meeting Uncle Zoid to discuss my dreams. don't be surprised if I've eaten. Uncle Zoid! You look young enough to be thrown back. Rich nephew! Come over here and give your uncle a nice, big meal. So, here we are. A still-famous film comedian. And a rich, respected doctor with surviving patients.",
"Eating in a restaurant, as we both often do. So, you want to be a comedian, is it? It's my lifelong dream. That dream dies now! You're unfunny and untalented! That's why you're perfect for drama! Serious drama? Perhaps it is time to give up comedy. I'm putting together a big drama picture as we speak. The script is dynamite! I know because I wrote it myself. By directing and starring… I'll be back on top after 50 miserable years. Where do I come in? This film has a juicy part for you.",
"So, are you in? Okay. How much do I have to invest? A million dollars. Then it's settled. Another big Hollywood deal! What can I get you? Is bread free? We'll split an order. What's with Monstro? He promised his uncle a million bucks. I've been here a day, and already I'm a Hollywood phony. Perhaps I could call on TV's Calculon to help… now that I'm in show biz. Since when have you been in the biz? Long enough, little man.",
"Long enough. I would be remiss if I didn't bring you scripts… that can make you an international film star. Tell me about the project. Interesting. Tell me more. Get this. For a scant $1 million investment… you can be the star. And? And it'll win you an Oscar. An Oscar, you say? of television once and for all. Let me see the script. No. No, I don't like the font. Wait! Harold Zoid? Was this written by the Harold Zoid? Written and xeroxed. Good heavens. A chance to work with the legendary Harold Zoid! He's one of my idols! You can guarantee me the Oscar? I can guarantee anything.",
"Then I'll do it! Hooray! Here's your checkbook! Ladies and gentlemen, our director… the legendary Harold Zoid! Thank you. A more classic movie plot there isn't. A son doesn't want to follow in his father's business. And that business is being president of Earth. The son is vice president. That makes sense. Wink, wink. You said, Wink, wink. No, I didn't. Raise middle finger. Now, remember, I can't stress this enough, this is a talkie. So I want the full gamut of emotions from every actor in every scene.",
"The Magnificent Three. Scene one, take one. And action! Take back your gilded pen, Father. Signing bills into law was always your dream, not mine. You've got to emote more! And you extras? Wave your arms! What is this, a morgue? The Magnificent Three. Scene 1 0, take 95. Action! And I mean circus-grade action. Sir? I call upon you, not as a president… but as a father! Would you show a little emotion? Just because it's a dramatic scene… doesn't mean you can't Throw a pie, for God's sake! Cut! Cut it! Look, it's all right, kid.",
"We'll get it in editing. That's a wrap! I'm gonna see you at the premiere! Editing is a long and expensive process. We spent all the money on pies, so it'll be ready Friday. Nice turnout. That Oscar's practically on your mantel. I just pray they like me I agreed to be your vice president! But I never agreed to be your son! Thank you, Lieutenant Smith. Good morning, Mr. Vice President. We're missing it! My life's goal is to attend a Hollywood shindig. It's the principle of the thing. I see a parking lot ahead.",
"I have asked you to join me on the White House roof. a heart-to-heart talk. I'll never follow in your footsteps! Here is my resignation as vice president! No! My son will not shame me I would sooner die, I would! Father! The ledge! The president is dead. Congratulations, Mr. President! He's a visionary! Everyone walked out. They hated it. Plagues have had better opening nights. You said the Oscar was practically mine! That's why I used the qualifier practically. You listen to me.",
"I'm out a million bucks! Get me that Oscar, or you're dead! You and these sniveling lobsters! Dead, you hear me? Dead! Four hundred categories and not a single nomination for me. But you won this Golden Globe! That's the Emmy of movie awards! I want an Oscar! Then maybe you should act better. It's not about acting… it's about earning the respect of the creative community! We could rig the awards. That's fine! It's no use. The tar is too thick. Plus, I think I flooded it. Well, we're gonna die.",
"We might as well enjoy the sights. Oh, my God! Sylvester Stallone! This is where you live? I thought you were a movie star. No, I'm not. I'm an even bigger liar than you! My career went down the day they invented Smell-A-Vision. Calculon's gonna kill us. It's all everybody else's fault! All I wanted was for people to think of me one last time before I die. What are you talking about? Everybody remembers Harold Zoid. As a pathetic has-been and forgotten relic, they remember me! It's better to die now.",
"No! This is one death I won't be responsible for. Zoidberg away! Hi. I'm Joan Rivers' head. I've had so many face-lifts, they finally lifted it right off my body! It's true! It's true! Here comes Jack Nicholson's DNA, reconstituted in a gorilla body! Catering. Here's washed-up actor what's-his-name, Harold Zoid. Are you presenting one of the awards or getting one? I'm a seat filler. My only marketable skill The second I don't win that award, you're cat food. And now, the host of the 1 07 4th Academy Awards.",
"Billy Crystal! Now I know how a Pez dispenser feels. Oh, you like that one, Jack? All right. We're already one hour behind. Our first award tonight, Best Cinematography. You want to play tic-tac-toe before we eat our shoes? Oh, I knew I'd die But a pit full of tar? What was that? A tar dolphin? Or a tar shark? It's some kind of hollow tube devoid of human life. We can blast our way in and escape! All right, but I still feel like having a shoe. What category is it? They're giving out minor awards.",
"They're up to writing. That leaves Best Product Placement… and Best Actor. There's no time. And the nominees for Best Product Placement areStar TrekThe Pepsi Generation. They Call Me Mr. Pibb. And Snow White and the 7 Ups. And now to present the award for Best Actor… a bit player in the flop movie The Magnificent Three… Dr. Zoidberg. Keep your prong on the trigger. And the nominees for Best Actor areSir Lawrence Ooooo in The Merchant of Venus.",
"Hive Mind Gamma Seven X in Bikini Party Summer. The Soda Machine Robot in Bikini Party Summer. Mark Jones in How Beige Was My Jacket. And, instead of the fifth guy, Calculon… for his powerhouse performance in The Magnificent Three. He read the wrong name. Play along, like with Marisa Tomei. Hooray! I won't be murdered! I'll live another day! Another day of… pathetic, forgotten misery. And the winner is. And the winner, instead of any of the nominees…",
"This is the legendary Harold Zoid! Thank you! Thank you so much! Through my ups and downs… I thought the most important thing in life was to win an Oscar. But tonight I realize what's really important is to win two Oscars! I'm kidding. What matters in life is that people care about you… whether it's a whole crowd… or just one die-hard fan. Thank you, nephew. Now I can die happy… 1 0 seconds from now, when Calculon kills us. Harold Zoid! Where's that Oscar? Here.",
"Enjoy. Why are you upset? It's less fraudulent for you to have it. Yes. Yes, it's a real beauty. Someday I hope to win one of my own. Then you're not gonna kill us? I respect and admire Harold Zoid Earthquake! Let the earth quake! I've got somebody's Oscar! We made it! I'm at a Hollywood party! I'm sorry. This is a private. Oh, pardon me. I see you're with Mr. Stallone. 1 Birdbot of IceCatraz Those cookies are fresh-a-licious, but they produce a lot of trash. That head spray makes your antenna smell nice.",
"Thank you. But it's damaging the planet. So? It's not the only one we've got. Good news! I'm sending you on an extremely controversial mission. Controversial? Oh, my, no. For this highly controversial mission, you'll be towing the Juan Valdez… an orbiting supertanker full of Colombian dark matter. Oil? What if we hit something, and the tanker leaks? The tanker has 6000 hulls. So, unlike me, it's entirely leakproof. Once you've hauled the tanker past the protestors. Protestors? Correct.",
"Six thousand hulls. Why do we fly within three feet of this penguin preserve? She's restocked with emergency jam. Let's get going. At the risk of sounding negative, no. I can't participate in this mission. What are you yapping about? Your reckless disregard for the environment! I'm gonna join those protestors. This is an outrage. I demand you hand over your captain's jacket. This is my normal jacket. I've had it 1 0 years. I said, hand it over. Well, Fry, or should I say Captain Fry? No, I shouldn't.",
"Bender is the new captain. Bender? That's right. Being captain is about intuition and heart. A good captain can't have either. That's why cold, logical Bender is perfect for the job. I do think of human life as expendable. No fair! Leela was training me to be captain. She let me sit on her lap and steer, in this comic I drew. The new one's out! The title of captain may inflate the human ego… but it's beneath the notice of my mighty robo-logic. Now, look spry, men. We launch at six bells.",
"Greetings. I'm Free Waterfall Sr. , founder of Penguins Unlimited. When you clap your hands… you kill thousands of spores that'll someday form a nutritious fungus. Just show your approval with a mold-friendly thumbs up. Please hold your thumbs until the end. It's time to stop that tanker with a nonviolent human circle. Why resort to nonviolence? Can't we kick their asses? are living things too. We're hitched up tighter than Davy Jones' U-Haul. At ease, men. I like to give my first mate an informal nickname.",
"From now on, you'll be known as Wiggles. The hell I will. Have you even read the captain's handbook? I have now. What's Peter Parrot's first rule of captaining? Always respect the chain o' command,captain. Correct, Wiggles. You've just earned an invitation to the captain's table. The captain's table? What an honor. Our peace ring has them trapped like a tiger in a washing machine. Get ready. Look at that. Here they come. Didn't you realize spaceships can move in three dimensions? No, I did not.",
"That tanker gave us the slip, but we'll stop them here on Pluto. If you're cold, rub your bodies with permafrost. It's nature's long johns. If rubbing dirt in your crotch is wrong, I don't wanna be right. This here is our penguin preserve. They're so cute, like if puppies and kittens could have babies. We use hand puppets around young ones to simulate a natural environment. That's adorable. It's this medal I'm most proud of. I won it for saving the children of Earth from a giant kangaroo.",
"It was on Australian news. You didn't see it. Brilliant. Would you cram a sock in it? Those aren't even medals. They're bottle caps and pepperoni slices. Thank you, steward. Weren't you about to toast your gallant captain? Fine, I've got a toast. To Captain Bender. He's the best… at being a jerk, and his ugly face I've heard better. If I were in charge, I wouldn't treat you like this. You're nothing but a blowhard. Sir, you forget yourself. Shut up. Being captain is more important to you than being my friend.",
"I'm going. Going? But a captain can't drink without his first mate. You can drink with me, maybe? I don't feel like drinking. Then if you'll excuse me… I see some ravioli that only has two shoe prints on it. Three. Please have some liquor. Robots need alcohol to function. I once knew a guy. He wasn't neither. I'm a good captain. Please, I love you like a father! Oh, I hope they read my sign! Bender's too low and upside down. He must be talking on a cell phone. What's happening? All 6000 hulls have been breached.",
"Fools. If only they'd built it with Continuing our coverage of a tragic, but faraway, story. The crisis on Pluto worsens as dark matter spreads. The images are truly horrific. I don't think any of us can understand how those poor penguins feel. Oily humanoid. At the time of the crash, the captain had an alcohol level of. 08 percent. for robots. As your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 1 2-piece bucket of trouble. But I struck you a deal. Five hours of community service…",
"Cleaning up that mess. Five hours? Couldn't you have just gotten me the death penalty? I'd have done better, but it's hard pleading a case… while awaiting trial for incompetence. from those Puffin twins. To avoid frostbite, put your hands between your buttocks. That's nature's pocket. I'll check on Bender. Watch so he doesn't pick your pocket. Can't beat fresh-squeezed. Bender, can you at least pretend you're being punished? Clean the black parts too. Are they black with white feathers.",
"White with black feathers? Don't matter. They're all beautiful. Yo, screws, more Tegrin over here. Man, he got away. This is why chief says no hugging. Good work, everyone. I'm gonna stay up singing songs about penguins in a fine, piercing tenor. Has anyone seen Bender? Bender! Here robot, robot, robot. Why weren't you Kong donkeys cleaning up? They sent us inside for doing an unsatisfactory job. And eating penguin eggs. Where's Captain Bender? Off catastrophizing some other planet? Damn it, Fry! He's still your captain! He didn't come back with the group.",
"He didn't? It's 20 degrees below absolute zero. I better go find him. Wait. Bender and I have disagreements, but we're still friends… and I'm gonna show him what that means. Why don't you walk? He was only 20 yards from here. Madam, I am in command now. Such a man. I'd follow him to hell and back, I would. What's this water made of, ice? Forget this! I don't think we're on Pluto. We may have left space as we know it. Then where are we? You said you knew how to navigate. Stop yelling at me.",
"It's worse than we thought. It seems dark matter is nature's sex drug. It's like a mix of penguin estrogen, penguin Viagra and Spanish penguin fly. It's making them ultrafertile. How ultra? A garden-variety penguin lays one egg a year. Since the spill, our penguins lay six eggs every 1 5 minutes! Also, the eggs hatch in only 1 2 hours! Also, the males are laying eggs! This man has overgasped! Soon, there will be too many birds to count. Before long, they will exhaust their food supply and starve to death.",
"If only we hadn't flown penguins to Pluto and dumped oil on them. Can't we stop them from multiplying? Yes. Thankfully, we have a plan. What is it? We'll do anything! Grab your guns. I declare penguin hunting season officially open! Isn't there some way to keep them from breeding? Cold showers don't work on Antarctic creatures. Surely, a quick semipainless death is better than weeks of starvation. But I joined Penguins Unlimited to love penguins, not hunt them. The two are one and the same.",
"Now, are you with us, or are you gonna let innocent penguins suffer? Oh, God, it's inhuman! It's like Hong Kong! I'll do it! That's a good old-fashioned gun. You're enjoying this! Look, if you have to shoot penguins, you might as well enjoy it. Sorry, if it's fun in any way, it's not environmentalism. Really? How about blowing up dams? Yeah, that is fun. Let's conservate! It's been an honor to serve under you! This is for their own good. Don't leave orphans. Gotta kill entire families. They're so cute.",
"No! You can do this. It's like murdering a little butler. I can't look. Oh, no! What have I done?! You poor little guy! I'm so sorry l. Bender?! Were you hiding out with these guys? Of course not! Filthy ice rats! What are you doing? Get away! Well, I don't love them. I don't know why, but when I look at their faces… it makes me want to puke! In a good way. Stop! Stop shooting! Sorry. Why aren't you firing at them? Don't you want to help them? You're not a tree-hugging kook at all! I don't know if shooting penguins will help or not.",
"But the decision shouldn't be in the hands of people who kill just for fun. You may just be farming some free-range truth there. But we already made 200 pounds of batter for penguin tempura. Okay, boys, it's them or us! Where did they. ? Make sure they use every part I'll avenge your death, son! I suppose this was your doing? I taught them if it ain't black and white, peck and bite. Guys, it's me, your lovable dictator! If only we had a toboggan! Faster! Faster! Right, they can swim. It's all coming back to me now.",
"It's Fry! reduce their population. Yeah, life is hilariously cruel. Permission to come aboard? Granted. We can't take off without our captain. And bring my toboggan. Were you able to help the penguins? Sure. I mean, not really. Nature will work itself out. It can't screw up any worse than we did, right? I don't know. Quit worrying! Thanks to my influence, those stupid birds will do just fine. 1 The Luck of the Fryfish Push, Mrs. Fry. You're almost there. Squeeze one out for America, honey.",
"Keep it down, it's the 9th inning. Here's the 0-2 pitch to Crypool. He's called on a strike three. Swing the bat, you bum! It's a boy with red hair. You saying my son's a commie? And Groady leans into the pitch. It hits him. The Mets win. Here's your baby. Okay, thanks. What should we name him? You pick. I picked dinner. I was thinking of Philip, after those screwdrivers. That's a fantastic idea. More morphine, please! Look, Yancy, it's baby Philip. I wanna be named Philip. Son, your name is Yancy, just like me, and my grandfather and so on.",
"Philip, until I find a suitable model of an ICBM. fearing this toy spacecraft. Mine! Mine! Come on! Baby needs new shoes. To hell with your baby. I need those shoes. It's a dead heat. They're checking the electron microscope. The winner is Number Three in a quantum finish. No fair! You changed the outcome by measuring it. How did you do, Fry? I'll tell you when my horse finishes. We owned four horses and two jockeys. He's perfect for you.",
"Hey, baby, ever do it in a suitcase? Look, it's a centaur race. Come on, come on! for good luck? I meant tongue luck. The winner is Number Four, Steven. I've run over black cats that were luckier than me. Get your hot horse-burgers, horse-fries, horse-cakes and shakes. Tongue straight from the horse's mouth. It all sounds good. All our horses are 100 % horse-fed for that double juiced-in goodness. I'll have a cholesterol-free omelet with horse-beaters. How can I horse you, sir? I'll have a horse Coke.",
"Horse Pepsi okay? Hey! What are you doing? Dear Horse God, I don't usually pray. Sometimes I doubt you even exist. But if you're willing to grant me luck, please, stamp your hoof once. Come on, Number Six. Move it! Don't do that. What are you. ? It's contagious. And the winner is Harry Trotter by the entire racetrack. That'll teach those horses to take drugs. That's it! You can only take my money for so long… before you take it all. I say, enough! I've got one dollar left, and this one I'm holding on to.",
"Oh, no, you don't. I may not know about horses, but I know lots about doing anything for $1. If you think bad luck can defeat me, you don't know my name is Philip J. That is one unlucky guy. Kareem has the sky hook, but Philip J. Fry has the space hook. Yancy drives, he goes up with his patented space hook. Hey! That's my patented space hook. You're not the president of it. Holy camolie! A seven-leaf clover. I'm dying of old age! Game over! Phil wins. Yancy's fans are stunned.",
"There'll be no celebration at the Yancy Dome. Someone's in a good mode. Let's say I lucked out at the track. Also I rigged one race. I'd have won too, if I still had my seven-leaf clover. Plus, I'd still have my hair. I got your page, Mr. Fry. Your new hair is ready. What happened to this clover? I hid it in a secret place and never told anyone. Not even Scruffy. So is it still in the hiding place? Yeah, maybe it is still there. In the ruins of Old New York. Helping one ant defeat another.",
"Or giving luck to a piece of dirt. Dirt doesn't need luck. I'm going to get my clover back! Some of the tunnels have metal bars. Who's good at bending? Sure. But Bending's my middle name. Yep. My full name is Bender Bending Rodriguez. Here's the entrance. From this moment, I declare my bad luck officially over. He was fun. If we get bored looking for the clover, I've got Tetris on this thing. Old New York. The city that inspired a casino in Las Vegas. We've got Manhattan all to ourselves.",
"I can finally do the crazy stuff I always dreamed. Howard Stern is overrated. New York is so burned. Remember when Giuliani cracked down on jaywalking? this action?

The moonwalk. The robot. The zero G. The robot. That's similar to mine. The zero G. You totally ripped off my routine. You calling me a biter? everything from me, Yancy? Stop illing.",
"Word. The septuple head-spin! He's just scratching. No one's done more than a quadruple. rewind the tape. Crazy sucker. Phil, you're hot. That was ice-cold, bro. Fry, if I ever see you try anything that crazy again… this crew might just have some new parachute pants. Stop hogging the clover. Let's go find that clover. Which way to your house? The sign says we're at 71 st Street. 71 st Street? Never heard of it. Downtown could be in any direction. We'll just take a spin on the B-train.",
"That feels funny! This is the Brooklyn-bound B-train, stopping wherever I feel like. Watch for the closing doors. Wake up, buddy. End of the line. My old neighborhood. That's the bench where I found shirts. We used to light that hydrant on fire! On that corner, some guy handed out a socialist newsletter. Was it poorly xeroxed? The comedians were right. This is different from L. A. Did you say you used to live here? That's right. Did you know Andy Goldman? He was my neighbor. Why? I mutated from him.",
"I'm teaching. He seemed nice. Sure, when he's sober. Holy camolie! The house I grew up in, it's still there! Man, Father Time really took That stupid clover is a worthless piece of garbage. Give it! Yancy's trying to steal my clover. Yancy, stealing is wrong. I'm gonna pile drive you. You're dead meat! What's happening? Did Kremlin Joe let fly with the nukes? Not yet, commander.

My dad spent years turning this into a bomb shelter. Yet there was no nuclear war. This is it. My Ronco Record Vault. I still remember the combination. Three. The Achilles' heel of the Ronco design is its structural resonance frequency. There we go. Here's The Breakfast Club soundtrack. You mean breakfast club sandwich? I hid my clover in the jacket so my brother, Yancy, wouldn't get it.",
"Here goes. It's gone! The whole place has been cleaned out. Yancy stole my clover. How do you know it didn't disintegrate? Everything else held up okay. Except Sports, by Huey Lewis. My brother hated me so much. Brothers always fight. He just never got a chance to say he loved you before you got frozen. You think? Because I always kind of wished that. Who is that godlike figure? It's my brother, Yancy. And there's my seven-leaf clover. I knew he stole it. If that's Yancy, why does the inscription say Philip J.",
"Fry? Wait a second. That's my name. Good Lord! He ditched his goofy name and stole mine. Apparently, this brave adonis, this Cadillac of men… was the first person on Mars. First person on Mars?! That should've been me! He stole my clover, he stole my name and he stole my life. And now he broke my hand. His legend lives on. You opened the vault, and the clover was gone? Nothing in there Survivor, Pat Benatar, The Scorpions. The list goes on. My brother stole my dream of going into space.",
"Now I'll never get there. You went this morning. First person on Mars. So your brother was that Philip J. Fry. I'm Philip J. Fry! He stole my name. Shut up, friends. My browser heard the word Fryand found the Philip J. Fry movie. It also opened my calendar to Friday and ordered some french fries. Philip J. Fry, astronaut, philanthropist, entrepreneur… was a great man, truly worthy of narration. Fry was the first man on Mars, a feat never equaled. It should've been me! The ever-lucky Fry made his fortune by striking oil.",
"He had won in a lottery. That's my clover. He stole it! After a fling with Icelandic supermodel, Njord… Fry scored many hits with his band, Leaf Seven… known for their hypnotic rhythms and memorable hooks. I'm known for that! Phil came and strummed out this tune. And I said that's a number-one record. Fry now spends most of his time in his grave at Orbiting Meadows Cemetery… buried with his trademark clover to bring him luck in the next life.",
"That's where my clover is. Is that cemetery near here? It will be in a couple of hours. Good, we're going grave robbing. Your tux will be perfect for my wedding, Dad. Yancy, that tux got me through Nam in style. I wish your bother could see this. I remember the day he disappeared. Wisconsin won the Rose Bowl 1 7-9. I was gonna rummage through Phil's records to play at the wedding. He may be missing, but his crap sure isn't. Breakfast Club. This will clear the room after the reception.",
"He's buried in the world heroes section? I'm impressed. I should be the one in that grave! We lost Bender. Now no one will be able to say I don't own John Larroquette's spine. Aha! My brother's grave! Philip Fry, the original Martian. It's all lies. He wasn't original. He wasn't a Martian. He wasn't Philip. He wasn't a the. You're twice the thehe ever was. It's clovering time.

In answer to your question, Hermes, yes, your friend is cured. Oh! Thank God! Notice he no longer suffers delusions of humanity. Affirmative. I feel nothing. I am a robot. Beep, beep, beep. You've made a terrible mistake. He's a human being. Not a machine! Oh, Fry! Gonna sing a little tale About a battle called Waterloo Bonjour, y'all! Fry, just because you think you're a robot doesn't make you one.",
"I think I'm a doctor, but that doesn't make me a doctor. These clothes do. I must be a robot. Why else would human women not date me? Oh, lots of reasons. Terminate noise exchange. It is time for you to ingest sandwiches from my compartment. Here we go. Just a minute. And down the stretch, it's Daddy's Little Grandpa… followed by Perennial Loser. Bringing up the rear, it's Lasty! Come on, Lasty! Hey, Bender. Roberto! What a surprise to see you in here! Especially because I didn't squeal.",
"Remember, I didn't squeal? Do you? Yeah. Now lie down and play dead. And don't ham it up. Sure. Anything for you, buddy. Wait here, Bender. I need to get a disguise. I'm in disguise'cause I wanna escape. You in? Or do I gotta kill you? I'm in! I'm in! When were you planning the breakout? I'm thinking, a few seconds ago. Quick! Let's keep escaping! Times two. Carry the one. Oh, you sad, worthless human. That was my anniversary gift from LaBarbra! Fear not, for I shall assist ye! Robots don't say ye.",
"Relax, mammal. My robotic software shall meet your calculatory needs. That's a plus sign, you loony! Quit thinking you're a robot! Stand back! I'm a tool-bot. You're not a tool-bot or a food-mo-tron. You're not a robot of any kind. Yes, I am. I simply haven't discovered my primary function yet. I'll remind Fry of his humanity, the way only a woman can. You're going to do his laundry? Fry, this is for you. Oh, for God's sake! By a scallop's forelocks, what's with all the beer? Alcohol fuels my power cells.",
"And, as a mighty robot, l. Thanks for helping me escape. It was nothing. It was not nothing! I want to repay you. Let me get you something in here. Hands up! This is a stickup again! Wow. Hitting the same place three times? I admire your style. Give me the remaining dough, the calendars and that pen. Tear it so most of the beads are on my end! Police. You're busted! And don't try anything. This glass is laser-proof. Fire lasers! Duck! Lasers! Come on! I got a place where I like to hide after crimes.",
"Hey, everybody. Meet my good pal, Roberto. Hey, mon. Come out with your hands up! Hooray! I'm helping! Do you have any better hostages? To show them who's crazy, Ouch! That's going to bleed when my heart beats. Wait! Take me first! Yes! Take her first! Shut up! Stop telling me Oh, the fear! I'm thinking of a number between one and 1 0. Guess it, and you die first. Man! Now that's all I can think about! I'm gonna kill you, you no good, 56-ing. ! Don't kill me! I'm coming down with Stockholm Syndrome.",
"Halt, fellow robot! Hey, Red! You're just in time to join the hostage situation. Which side do you want to be on? The side that kicks your metal ass. Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! Negative, bossy meat creature. I now know my primary functionI am a battle-droid, protecting the weak from crazy robots. I'm not crazy! Don't call me crazy! I'm just not user-friendly. Don't be a hero! It's not covered by the health plan! Let's see how much of a robot you really are! No knife can penetrate my skin-tanium armor.",

You did it, Fry. Congratulations, buddy. You're a credit to my race. It was nothing. l. Blood? Robots don't have blood. A human! Oh, my God! I'm a human! Thanks for saving us, Fry. I'm gonna continue never washing this cheek again. You may be wrapped in greasy skin, but inside you have the heart of a robot.",
"Thanks, Bender. Just like inside me, I've got the heart of a human. Bendin' in the Wind of olestra chips from my time! There must be layers and layers of old stuff down there. Is that one of those Led Zeppelins? No, it's an old Volkswagen van! Mind if I take this old van? Sure. You wanna dump the corpses out of there, it's yours. Yeah, I've gotten used cars before. One of those Jefferson Starships? It's called a van. And in light of the fact it's not rocking, I invite you to come knocking.",
"It's a triumph of German engineering! The speedometer only goes up to 80. It can't go faster than 80,000 mph? No, but it's got a driver's-side floor and an eight-track player! Where's the device that lets you speed or slow the passage of time? Under the seat. Why won't it start? It needs gas. Wrong again, idiot. There is no gas. Petroleum reserves ran dry in 2038. Gas was an environmental disaster. We use alternative fuels. Bender, lift it up to the can opener. Oh, no! Last time, that magnetic psycho nearly cut my head off! Plus the magnet impairs your inhibition unit and makes you sing folk songs.",
"What? Who said anything about me secretly wanting to be a folk singer? If you don't open that can now, your fear will own you, and nothing's worse! Okay! Okay, I can do this. It's time to take life by the cans. Come on, you can do it! Go on, you dummy! Oh, no! It's toe-tappingly tragic! Doc, I can't move my arms and legs! What's wrong with me? This is the worst part of the job. Good news? Bender, your hydraulics are shot. You'll never move again. You mean. ? Sorry, you'll have to get a new one.",
"Poor Bender! Well, let's drag him to the curb. Wait! Bender is my best friend. We can't just dump him in the gutter like Grandma's ashes. My life is over. I'll never know happiness again! Hello, there. Look! It's Patch Cord Adams! He heals with the power of laughter. Come on, take it. Can't move your arms? No, or I'd be strangling you right now! Here's a giggle! Why do they use Windows 3000 as a prison guard? For God's sake, somebody kick his ass! Well, so long. Get well soon. Well, so long anyway.",
"Everybody leave me alone! I don't want to be seen this way. You look so sad. Do you want me to send Patch Cord Adams back in? Hey, the blues! The tragic sound of other people suffering. That's kind of a pick-me-up. That was great! Thanks. Are you a fan? I don't know. Let me see. Oh, my God, you're Beck! I'd get up to shake hands and steal your wallet, but my body crapped out… but then I fished this mannequin out of the 92˘ Store dumpster. We've got a lot in common. I always dreamed of being a musician-poet.",
"Who transcends genres even as he reinvents them. So do it. It's easier than it looks. Thanks, but it's hopeless. I'll never be a musician now. Or maybe… you'll be the best musician ever. What's this for? Try and scrape it across your chest like a knife on burnt toast. Move those arms! Use the power of mental thinking. Make it dynamic! Yeah! Congratulations, my friend. Why,'cause I made an annoying noise? I use those all the time in my music. Bender, I want you to be my new washboard player.",
"All right! Go Bender! Go Bender! Go Bender! That's my good friend Beck. I'm off to rock a series of midlevel venues. Kudos, Bender! You got mangled, and now you're a singer. Both our dreams came true. Who wants to cram in my van, follow Bender on tour and live in the van? I don't know, Fry. I think I'm too poor to follow a band around in a van. Move it! We gotta get to the concert and make the audience wait! Bad news, friends. My shell ran. Zoidberg, you idiot! Kind of cool! Me too, now that I'm used to it.",
"Then it was all on purpose! You're lucky to have me as a friend. But cross me, and I'll turn on you like that! Got a washboard stomach And a microphone That was a washboard break One bowl of Jell-O knuckles. That'll be three pictures of George Washington. Oh, no! My beautiful money! It got ruined in the wash! Mine too, even my change. Get lost, you moneyless hippies! You heard him, freaks! We don't like your type around here! These are the types we like. That was the best 40-minute washboard solo I've ever heard.",
"The parts when I was awake blew my mind! Check out all those broken robots. I don't believe my broken eyes! It's Bender, the washboard player! We caught your concert from here. You rock! Bender, sign my chest! It's in that bin behind me! Thanks for showing that broken robots are still useful. Hang in there, folks. I bet before you know it, you guys will be. That's so wrong! They can't just melt down broken robots! Not right when they're kissing my ass. When I'm upset, I write a song.",
"I wrote Devil's Haircutwhen I was feeling. What's that song about? Yeah, I could write a song! With real words, not phony ones like odelay. Odelay is a word. Look it up in the Becktionary. I'm working on my song. Hand me the Becktionary. No, the rhyming Becktionary. I'd like to raise awareness about broken robots… but what can I do? I only weigh 8 pounds. Wait! You know lots of rock stars, and they like to look like they care. We can all do a big benefit concert in San Francisco! We can call it Bend-Aid,after me! And you can sing your song! And I'll let you sing backup! But remember who the star is.",
"Me, Bender. All right. Hands in the airrhymes with just don't careand finished! Smells like something died in here. Surprise! Can we crash here? The colors in the van keep us awake. All right, but hands off the minibar. I forgot about TV. Living on the road, you realize life is better without it. Well, let's see what's on. Tuesday, Golden Gate Park! Monsters of vaguely folkish alterna-rock… will strum your brains out at Bend-Aid! FeaturingBeck, Wailing Fungus, and special guest, Bender! A portion of the proceeds might go to help broken robots.",
"Bender, you're famous! This coming together of superstars really means a lot to you, doesn't it? Helping my defective brothers is the first thing I've ever cared about. You know, when I first got broken, I thought my life was over. But look at me now. I've got fame, money, groupies… and it's all thanks to being completely immobilized. That's why I'll be proud to go up on stage and say, Look at me… I am a broken robot!Bender! You can move! You're cured! Oh, crap! It's a miracle.",
"I can move again. My music career is over. I don't understand the biz, but wouldn't being able to move help? No! Don't you see? I was a hero to broken robots. I was one of them. How can I sing about being damaged if I'm not? That's like Christina Aguilera singing in Spanish. Don't do that at the concert. I can't stop. When I eat too much dirt, I get stuff in my throat. You are so disgusting! l. They're beautiful! You're touching them! I've never seen pearls like this. You're amazing! I am? At last! Recognition! Put your hands together for the folk stylings.",
"Here's a song that was beautiful when performed by my ancestor Art. We're home. Let's earn some bread. Get your love beads! Can't journey to your mind's center without them! Look at the colors! These will go great with my soul. Glad you like them. I've been making fine jewelry for years, apparently. I'll take three! Give me one, man! I'll trade you a bad poem! And now, stand up and turn on your hidden tape recorders for. Beck! Bender, the broken robot! Bender rules! Groove on, man! Rock it, Bender! That song doesn't usually last three hours.",
"Anyway, one last item of business before we go. Bender, to start your foundation for broken robots… here's a big cardboard check for $14,000. It's been an emotional day for me. I don't know what to say. Then maybe you should sing it. Lay it down, boys. Ladies, gentlemen, smoking heaps of machinery… this is a song called My Broken Friend. People say my broken friend is useless But I say his mind is free There's lots of things My mangled robot friend could be He could make a good hatrack He only has to stand there Or a cheap doorstop He doesn't need to move Or a great big, giant thermos That would be good for soup He could be a storage closet For outdated pants My broken friend could do it all Just give him a chance That robot has a tragic secret That I'd like to share My broken friend is closer to me Than an ass to a chair That robot's name I never told you You could not foresee I'll say it loud and sing it proud His name is you and me Don't melt me into a crowbar It suffers alone Just'cause I can't move my arms and legs Or toss me into a trashcan What are you doing? Because I can't cook eggs What are you doing?! Don't crush me into an anchor Because I can't dance and sing I'm telling you, my broken friend Put your hands in the air Like you just don't care I'm telling you, my broken friend Can do most anything Curse my natural showmanship! You big fat fraud! You're not really broken! Bum rush the stage! Oh, harsh! I didn't get my beads! You, minion, lift up my arm.",
"After him! Everyone, prepare to get your guts kicked out by folk singers. What is this, the Year of the Jerk?! The Golden Gate Bridge! Put the metal to the pedal to the other metal! I forgot it's a hoverbridge! I forgot this isn't a hover car! Is that a problem? without regret. Quick, grab his foot cuffs! Bummer. Someone fat, get in my way! I'm broken again. I can't move any part of me! I'm sorry I lied, Beck. I just wanted to make music with you. I never meant to hurt anyone…",
"That's some played-out horsecrap! But I know you don't mean it. So I can keep the check? Over my dead career. Well, it was worth a shot. If you're done scamming Beck, we're heading home! All right. Let me just do one thing to cheer myself up. 1 Time Keeps On Slipping How about a romantic ride in one of those swan boats? They're dangerous, but I've mastered them. Those aren't swan boats. They're swans. That explains these boat eggs. Pitiful ballplayers of Earth…",

There's nothing at stake… beyond the shame of defeat. This will not stand. I'll take you on, you air-balling bozos. You, old man? Sweet Clyde, laugh derisively at him.",

They're still young. Mere atomic superboys, really. We'll speed up their growth with time particles called Cronotons. Those destroyed an entire civili. Good news, everyone. You're off to the Tempest Nebula to gather Cronotons. Your face can take a lot of punishment. Good to know. There's a lot about my face you don't know.",
"You and it should get acquainted. Cool your jets, hotshot. Why won't you go out with me? We both know there's something there. No, I mean, cool your jets… they're melting Bender's face. Here you go. Hot off the nebula. None too soon. The Trotters held a news conference to announce that I was a jive sucker. Behold! My invincible nuclear mutants. Marv Albert here at Madison Cube Garden… where the Globetrotters take on a squad of atomic supermen… in what should be a by-the-numbers contest with no surprises whatsoever.",
"Here's the tip-off. Globetrotter ball. Clyde Dixon to Bubblegum Tate. Drives downcourt… and Curly Joe from the rear. That one grabbed his behindus. Who dares laugh at the Jesters of Dunk? We came to terrify and humiliate you, not tickle your funny bones. Watch as I embarrass your civilization by passing the ball to Curly Joe. Only to have it remain in my hands with elastic. And perhaps this will wipe the smiles from your faces. Rejected. Agrow-treant from half court. Yes! Supermen lead 45-42.",
"Aracneon with the steal. Thorais from downtown. Yes! He's showing us what a man with a cannon in his chest can do. No showboating, you atomic hotdog. And that's the half, with the Supermen up 48-42. Surprisingly dull so far. The Trotters are down by six. Reactions? We planned to trail at the half, thus deepening Earth's eventual humiliation. were the refs watching? Curly Joe, easily amused by his own antics, continues to wreak havoc on. What happened? Did everything just jump around? Or did my brain just stroke off there? Something very strange has just happened.",
"What's happening? We're lurching forward in time… like a needle skipping on a record. What's causing it? Is it my outfit? It must have something to do with those time particles I used. Time and space are ripping apart Oh, great. Now, on top of everything, we need a new fifth man. Put me in. I wanna show Leela Who cares? We're 35 points ahead with two minutes left. What could possibly. ? Globetrotters win, 244-86.",
"A dark day for humanity, folks. We have been beaten in basketball. You are all fools of the highest caliber. I don't know what you did, Fry, but you screwed up. Now all the planets are gonna crack wise about our mamas. I'm glad my fat mama isn't alive. Enough about your promiscuous mom… we have bigger problems. This time disruption is serious. Damn right, man. This chronological wang-dang-doodle could destroy the matrix of reality. Tate, what do you know about this?",
"But I am senior lecturer in physics at Globetrotter U. I'd like to help. You're that Bubblegum Tate? I sure ain't his grandma. Look here. We got an excess of Cronotons in the subatomic interstices. Something involving that many big words could destabilize time itself. Is that a problem? Indeed. At this rate, by Tuesday it'll be Thursday. By Wednesday it'll be August. And by Thursday, it will be the end of existence as we know it. I have to ask you to clear out. The circus needs to set up for tomorrow's.",
"Time continues to skip forward randomly. This is the news at 1 1. The unexplained. Turning to entertainment news… teen singer Wendy might be the. Won three Grammys last night. Found dead in her bathtub. Interesting. We behave normally during the time skips, but we have no memory of it. You mean we just. Any luck, Bubblegum? Hope you don't mind if I dribble. Not if you grant me the same liberty. Bubblegum, I'm a huge fan of your work, both on and off the court.",
"Can I be a Globetrotter? Shut up, turkey. Bubblegum, look. The background time radiation is fluctuating wildly. That sucker's shaking like fine booty. I'm no physicist, but I think I know how to stop the skipping. We'll just. I don't know how this was supposed to work. I hope you find out what's wrong before we skip my birthd. Happy birthday, Amy. Hooray, look at all these presents. I hope we all have as much fun tomorrow at my birth. What? I've set up a time-proof shelter in the closet.",
"You're the one I want to share it with. Fry, that's so sweet. Let me see. How will this protect us from time jumps? Because when we're together in here, baby, time will stand still. Zoidberg, can I talk to you about Fry? Leela, I would be honored. does the worst W. C. Fields imitation I've ever seen. Zoidberg? Sorry, you must have been boring me. The thing is, Fry is very sweet. But he's so immature. I love his boyish charm, but I hate his childishness. So he's not perfect. You don't wanna end up old and lonely like Zoidberg! You were saying? There it is.",
"The Tempest Nebula. Take a whiff through the Smell-a-Scope. What's that funky jazz? The odor of pure time leaking. When we removed the Cronotons, it destabilized the nebula… causing time skips throughout the universe. Pretend these balls are time particles. As the nebula bounce-passes, they cause dents, or time skips. You are so smart. What if we were to move this star cluster to these algebraic coordinates? Their gravity may divert the Cronotons to the empty side of the universe.",
"Moving stars requires a bad-ass gravity pump. We'd need all the money on Earth to build. Here's funding. It better work. We can't spend all of Earth's money every day. How long will it take to build? It won't be easy. take months or even. There we are. One gravity pump. Powerful enough to move the stars themselves. Now to begin the arduous task of attaching it to the ship. Off you go, apparently. Easy, Leela. Just finger-roll that star to the cosmic basket. Just a few more.",
"There. Nothing but nebula. I think we've stopped the time skips. All right. Hooray for Leela. What better way to celebrate than by showing Bubblegum… the Globetrotter uniform I made. I want you to know I think the way you moved those stars was wonderful. I got you something. Moderately priced, non-vintage champagne? How did you know? You deserve it. Nobody ever stops to tell you what a great captain you are. That is so true and sweet. You're smart, beautiful, and best Fry, please try to understand.",
"You're a man. I'm a woman. We're too different. Bubblegum might let me organize a bake sale for the Globetrotter wives. Can you teach me to make cupcakes? All right. I want to lick the beaters. I got her champagne. It's time to win Leela's heart with a showy, three-point romantic gesture. Maybe this is the moment to show her my real surprise. Fry, what are you doing? Time to boogie on down to the sauna. I've been studying how to pilot. Impressed? Yeah, actually. You're doing okay.",
"The reactor temperature is nominal. The blinker's off. I learned to work the gravity pump too, in case we need it. So are we dating now? Please, cut it out now. I know there's some perfect thing I can do to make you love me. When I figure out what it is. I don't wanna hurt you… but there is absolutely, positively no way that you and I will ever. man and wife. You may kiss the bride. He looks radiant. The time skips haven't stopped. Even in these formal shorts, I feel like a failure.",
"You tricked me into marrying you, didn't you? Of course not. How'd you do it? Drugs? Hypnosis? No, drugs are for losers. And hypnosis is for losers with big eyebrows. I don't know what I did to make you love me. But we're married now. We've got the rest of our lives. The divorce is final. Let's divide up the china. and you can have the AFC. Fine. Break my heart again. Don't be so hard on yourself. You lost the woman of your dreams… but you still have Zoidberg. You all still have Zoidberg.",
"I've got to figure it out. Maybe you're just a fantastic lover. I don't know what I'm doing. I were a Globetrotter. Hell, no. It's hopeless. I did something so great it won Leela's heart… and I'll never, ever know Zoidberg. No wonder we failed. Diverting Cronotons is mathematically impossible. I knew I should have checked your showboating algebra. I thought you knew that algebra was all razzmatazz. A Globetrotter always saves the good algebra for the final minutes. Vintage Bubblegum.",
"The time skips are worse. Isolated spots are jumping by years. Look. Stupid senior citizens! Why should we pay for their benefits? I deserve free money! I'm stumped. We'll have to call in the finest scientific minds in the univer. We could explode the whole nebula. What do you think, Curly Joe? An explosion big enough to destroy that mama would take out half the universe. You got to Globetrotter that explosion up a little. Make it an implosion. By God, Sweet Clyde is right. An implosion might form a black hole that'd stop Cronotons from escaping.",
"We'd need some kind Now the ball's in Farnsworth's court. I suppose I could part with one and still be feared. Give me some skin, prof. I'm making you an honorary Globetrotter. In fact, everybody in this room's an honorary Globetrotter. I'm a Globetrotter! Crap! We must leave now, for we are needed elsewhere. But we wish you Godspeed. I can make myself taller. You can talk trash. You can handle the ball. But ask yourself, are you funky enough to be a Globetrotter? Are you? Are you? I mean, with time my funk level.",
"Are you? Careful with that doomsday device. What does it matter? I'll never be a Globetrotter. My life, and, by extension, everyone else's, is meaningless. Roger. Leela, I don't know what I don't think I tricked you, And if I did, I'm sorry. It's okay, Fry. You know we'll always be friends. I don't guess anything I do will make you feel for me the way I feel for you. I guess not. The doomsday device is ready. Maybe blasting this space into a storm of nothingness will cheer me up.",
"Actually, I think I'll go and prep the detonator. Fry, why don't you take the helm. She's so great. I almost remember the thing I did to make her love me. But I never will. Sorry, buddy. I too know what it's like to have a dream I'll never achieve. the stars to write her a love note. Detonation in three, two, one. The explosion? No, not the explosion. Then what?

"Anyone who misses this will regret it forever. Fry, could you go make some popcorn? Let's go, microwave. I'm in a hurry here. Fry, get up here. It's starting. Oh, no. Which crazy thing happening are you guys screaming about? My head is spinning. My popcorn's done. It's less popped than ever. I don't know what happened, but we've taken on clocks. Let's go home. Why is there so little traffic? What's this layer of ozone? That's never been there before. Such noises. There's no global-Positioning signal.",
"Navigation is failing. We're gonna crash! Not if I can help it. I guess I can't. Everyone put on your seat belts. Those cost more lives than they save. Bender, are you okay? Don't know. I'll try to move my feet. Here's the plan. Zoidberg, pick up the pieces. Everyone else, take five. Zoidberg picks up another piece. The crowd goes wild. In all my years of covering top-Secret discoveries with sheets. I've never dramatically revealed anything this shocking. Dun-Dun-Dun! The debris from an alien spaceship.",

I'm up for whatever. We tore the universe a new space hole. But it's clenching shut fast. Our only hope to get back to our time is to go back through within, say Exactly 24 hours. Ship's fixed except for the cup holder. It should be operational in 10 hours. But more urgent is the microwave.",
"Without one, we have no hope of returning to the future. I'm sure we can buy one somewhere. You sneak onto the Army base and rescue Bender's body. I'll visit my grandfather, Enus.

"Why did you come to Earth? I don't ask myself that. Enus! I want that toilet so clean I could eat off it. Because I intend to. Gadzooks, sarge. It's my grandfather, Enus. Now, prepare my lunch and place it in the latrine at 1200 hours. That jeep's gonna hit him, and I won't exist anymore! You almost got yourself run over. Then I am lucky you knocked me onto this pile of rusty bayonets. Stop interfering with history. I don't want to have to memorize new kings. I had no choice. I was about to not exist.",
"I could feel myself fading away, like Greg Kinnear. Thanks, soldier. I'm off to make sarge's lunch. Handling raw chicken? Best part of the job. Finger-Licking good. We gotta get you out of here. Everything's gonna be all right, Dad. Gadzooks, I'd better ask sarge. No time. Run! Run to safety. This experiment will determine what food, if any, the alien eats. A buffet.

I'm sorry. Now, I'll ax you again. Where can we find a microwave? She's hysterical, so I'll talk to you. This oven takes only five hours to cook a roast. That's good news.

"Just concentrate on staying alive. Fire! Look out! You almost got neutered. Ain't as bad as killed. For me it is. I'm getting you out of here. We're in the middle of nowhere, the safest part. Just stay put and enjoy this calendar. Safe and sound. Finally, I can continue to exist. Three, two, one. And you are out of here. I'll have soylent green. With a soylent orange and soylent coleslaw. Pardon? It's the 20th century. I'll have a croque monsieur, paella, two mutton pills and a stein of mead.",
"I'll have an injection of Fem-A-Slim. Two chili dogs coming up. Settle in. Without a microwave, we're trapped. Oh, lord! We'll have to endure the horrible music of the Big Bopper. And then the terrible tragedy of his death. There's a microwave radar dish at the Army base. We could steal it. That would alter history. It is our sacred duty to preserve Well, I killed my grandfather. I don't know. Maybe God loves me. Killed? In an atomic blast? No, I don't take solace in the fact.",
"That the implosion trigger functioned perfectly. There, there. If it makes you feel any better. He was vaporized, so he can't come back as a zombie. I'm not worried about that. Then you're braver than I. You remind me of Enus. Mind walking me home? How far is it? Welcome, President Truman. This visit's top-Secret. No one's to know, except officers, scientists. And a conspiracy nut who no one will believe. Our experts have reassembled the parts from the alien ship. Into its original design.",
"I want this sent to Area 51 for study. Where we're building the fake moon landing? We'll have to really land on the moon. Invent NASA and tell them. If you come in peace, surrender. If you're here to make war, we surrender. The important thing is, I'm meeting new people. What's your mission? Are you planning a kind of alien-Human hybrid? Are you coming on to me? I take exception to that. I'm not hearing a no. Nerts to this crab. We'll have to do an old-Fashioned alien autopsy. Hooray! Every little thing reminds me of Enus.",
"I know how you feel. My grandfather died recently. I just need someone to hold me. Mm. You like holding me, don't you? Know what always cheers you up? Baking me sugar cookies. How about these cookies, sugar? I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't exist. But I do exist. Which proves you can't really be my grandma. What the hell have you done?! Relax. She can't be my grandmother. I figured it out. Of course she's your grandmother, you perverted dope. Look. Come back to bed, dearie. Impossible.",
"If she's my grandmother, who's my grandfather? Isn't it obvious? You are. Did you say something, dearie? I'm a bit hard of hearing. Commencing excavation of And in this corner, Zoidberg. Come on, lighten up. What is this, a funeral? Heart. Take. I've got four of them. Stomach contents. One deviled egg. Snap out of it! Start the ship. Let's steal the radar dish and get back to our own time. Won't that change history? A lesson in not changing history from Mr. I'm-My-Own-Grandpa. Let's get the hell out of here.",
"Screw history. Don't cut that. I need that to speak. Great Roosevelt's ghost! Take this, Mr. President. Sir. The president is gagging on my gas bladder. What an honor. Wha. ? Oh, right. Enus! He's dead. Sorry! Choke on that, causality! We've got to go back for Bender. Impossible! The time hole is closing. If we don't leave now, we'll never get back to the 31 st century. Bender! There, good as new. Don't you need this one? Oh, no. That's my. Oh, poor Bender. He must be so lonely right now, trapped 1000 years in the past.",
"Hey, wait a second. Anything? Oh! Stupid jerk. Bender! What was it like lying in that hole for 1000 years? I was enjoying it until you showed up. Now everything is back as it was. If history doesn't care that our degenerate friend, Fry. Is his own grandfather, who are we to judge? Amen. Tale of Two Santas In true winter tradition, members of the Zarlon 7 Polar Bear Club… today took the plunge into a river of liquid ammonia. There were no survivors. It takes all kinds. Now, with his annual message, here's the head of the Xmas Safety CouncilThe head of Walter Cronkite.",
"Season's warnings. This guy's too trustworthy. What's his angle? In all the tinsel and terror of the holiday season… we underestimate that murderous brute known as Santa Claus. With images of last year's Gingerbread Massacre baked into our memories… I remind you to bolt your doors, say goodbye to your pets… and lock your children in the closet. This is Walter Cronkite saying, Sacred boar of Western Samoa! We must secure for Santa's arrival! Fine. I'm getting tired Cover that fireplace! I've only a few years to live.",
"I don't want to spend them dead. We're pushing as hard as we can. Oh! Pushing. We're doomed. Every year we're doomed. Thanks be I had these bulletproof shutters installed. Bring it on, Santa. That vicious cadaver-junkie can't touch us… as long as we're not stupid enough to leave this building. In a related matter, you'll deliver this sack of letters… directly to Santa at his death fortress on Neptune. These letters are real butt-nutters. Listen to this. Dear Santa.",
"Please, please don't bring me any gifts. The bicycle you fired at me last year from your bike gun tore up my insides. Awful! Let's read some more. Dear Santa. Please bring me a coffin for Grandpa. You choked him with a chestnut last year, and he's beginning to smell. In my day, Xmas was supposed to bring people together, not blow them apart. Sure, but who's gonna do anything about it? Not us. No, sir. Yes, us. We've got to bring back the kind of Xmas I remember. Fry's right.",
"It's time to sit on Santa's lap, and hard! Look, a cute little welcoming party. Want to buy a tiny kidney? I'll let you punch me for a buck. Look, we've got mail for Santa. Are you his elves? No, we're Neptunians. We're tiny because he won't feed us. You hit me. You owe me a dollar. Got any food? Old tea bags, chewed gum, apple cores? We're starving here! You live in a gingerbread house. It's food or shelter, not both. Don't you get paid for making toys? False alarm, folks. There's no toys made.",
"Santa says everyone is naughty. That's it! I'm delivering my boot up Santa's chimney. Where is he? There, in his ice fortress. We'll need help getting in. Any volunteers? An omen? Dinner. Let's see who's been naughty and who's been naughty. Mobsters beating up a shopkeeper for protection money. Very naughty. Shopkeepers not paying protection money. Exactly as naughty. We brought your mail. Don't you ever knock? Who knows what naughty things I could be watching? I get New Orleans on this thing.",
"Don't kill us! Santa's a robot. We should be able to destroy him with a logical paradox. Bender, you better cover your ears. Holy night! Intruders! Hold it, Santa. Consider thisYou are programmed to destroy the naughty. But many of those you destroy are in fact nice. I submit that you are naughty. So, logically, you must destroy yourself. Nice try, but my head was built with paradox-absorbing crumple zones. Wait! This is what we're running from. Faster! Faster! Why aren't we moving? I don't know.",
"Usually when I do stuff like this He's trapped. Hooray! Now we can make toys again! And I can deliver them. Billions and billions in one night. No human could do all that. Evel Knievel could. Santa's right. We need some sort of robot. Crap! I'm some sort of robot. Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Bender can't be Santa. He wasn't built to Yuletide specifications. I wasn't built to steal Leela's purse either, but that didn't stop me. Bender! Bow before your new Santa. Our hero! We are free and fairly sober With so many toys to build The machines are kind of tricky Probably someone will be killed But we gladly work for nothing Because we don't intend to pay The elves are back to work today Hooray We have just a couple hours To make several billion gifts And the labor isn't easy Then you'll all work triple shifts You can make the job go quicker If you turn the controls to super speed It's back to work on Xmas Eve Hooray And though you're cold, sore and ugly Your pride will mask the pain Let my happy smile warm your hearts There's a toy lodged in my brain We are getting awfully tired And we can't work any faster We're very, very sorry You selfish little bastards The kids will think Santa is a jerk Then shut your yaps and back to work Now it's very nearly Xmas And we've done the best we could These are poorly painted And made from inferior wood I should give you all a beating If I weren't stuck here I'd harpoon you in the eye Now it's back to our tenements To drown ourselves in rye Some of these gorillas are okay Hooray! We're adequate! The elves have rescued Xmas Day Hooray Gee, how are you gonna get through these bars? I don't know, moron.",
"Suppose I bend them? Mommy! Santa's through the perimeter! Kids, take your suicide pills so you won't suffer! No, wait! I'm the good Santa. I've got toys at reasonable prices. He's the father of all lies and the uncle of all tricks! I've come bearing Tri-Ominos. Go for the shins! One down. Well, hello there, handsome. Won't you have a cookie? Don't mind if I do. What's in these things? Why don't you slip into something more fiery? Yo, Kringle, what happened to you, dog? It's awful, Kwanza-Bot.",
"Everyone hates me. At least they understand you. Nobody's down with this Kwanza tip. Hey, maybe you can lend me a hand. I gotta hand out the Kwanza book. I've been giving these out for 647 years. Bathtub eggnog, just the way Grandma used to drink. It went sour! Can't I have a scented bath in peace? Remember, professor, Bender is Santa. So we don't need to hurt him, right? You sound like a broken MP3. Professor, don't you remember There's gotta be a better way. Bender, you're a genius.",
"This creates an unrealistic standard of beauty. Now it's time for Santa to screw open his present. It's Santa! We've got him cornered. I smell a juicy promotion for me. And a juicy rehiring for me. This Xmas Day session of court will come to order. Honorable Judge Whitey presiding. Santa, you stand accused of crimes against humanity. How do you plead? Not Santa. There he is again! Now, Pramala, I know it's scary in the witness box. But there ain't no need to fear me. I'm sorry. I thought you was corn.",
"Now, would you please point at that robot over there? No further questions. Daddy done good, huh? Haven't you been paid to testify? You gave me a dollar and some candy. Yet you haven't said what I told you to say. How can we trust you? Quit badgering the witness. Badger? Where? Whereas I have a ham dinner waiting for me at my mansion… I find the defendant guilty. Santa Claus, I hereby sentence you to be executed at sundown. It's not fair. I hope that dumb chicken Deactivated robot walking! Deactivated robot walking here! Santa, when you see the robot devil, tell him I'm coming.",
"I heard him. Greetings, masters. My companion and I made lots of toys. Out of my way. We're taking Santa to prove Bender's innocence. There. Oh, no! The ice is melting! The factory's pollution caused a greenhouse effect. That would explain this heat. And your shorts. Yeah, that would explain it. We've got to think of a way to save Bender, or Xmas will be ruined! Especially for Bender. Look out, Earth. I'm dreaming of a red Xmas. When I pull the switch, these electromagnets will tear you apart.",
"A most humane death. But that doesn't sound humane! It is for the witnesses because it's not boring. When this random-number generator reaches zero, you'll be executed. Ten. Three. Twelve. Threeagain. Stop the execution! Fifteen. Negative eight. I'll prove you've got the wrong Santa. I'm Santa Claus! What? Twenty-seven. No, I'm Santa Claus. We're also Santa Claus. And I'm his friend, Jesus. You people aren't Santa. You're not even robots. Ninety-one. How dare you lie in front of Jesus! Hey, zero! No! Not the magnet! This is horrible.",
"But it's not boring. My God! The real Santa! Santa, you saved my life. Please don't kill me! I'm not here to kill you, Bender. I need you to help me save Xmas. Gee whiz, Santa, you want me to help you? Don't do it! He's evil! I know he is, but I have no choice. I'm late. If I don't complete my brutal rampage, it just wouldn't be Xmas. I guess what I'm asking isBender, won't you join my slaying tonight? Well,'tis the season. My hair! My wedding cake! Let it snow! Merry Xmas, kids. This wangs chung.",
"After all the good we tried to do, Xmas turned out rotten. No power. Huddled together in fear like lice in a burning wig. Maybe your futuristic Xmas isn't so rotten after all. What are you talking about? You said it yourselfXmas should bring people together, not blow them apart. Don't you see? Fear has brought us together. That's the magic of Xmas. That's a big crock of. On, Trasher! On, Smasher! Kwanza-Bot, where you off to? Didn't you hear? Chanukah Zombie is having a luau. You coming? Word! Here's a small token of my appreciation for being Santa while I was trapped.",
"Chief, you screwed up. There's nothing here. Oh, it might appear empty but the message is clearPlay Santa again, and I'll kill you next year! Anthology of Interest 2 There. I've finished fine-tuning my What If Machine. It can answer any What if,accurate to one-tenth of a plausibility unit. Who wants to see an alternate reality? I want to know what would happen if I were human. Being a robot's great, but we don't have emotions… and sometimes that makes me very sad. Oh, Lordy Lou, there he goes again! Well, let's give baby what he wants.",
"What if Bender were human? Good news! I've invented a way to turn Bender into a human… using the process I call reverse fossilization. How does it work? In regular fossilization, flesh and bone turn to minerals. Realizing that, it was simple to reverse the process. I've already tested it by turning the toaster into a raccoon. Kind of gamy. Ready, Bender? I don't know. I'm beginning to have some second thoughts. Cover your shame, mon! It worked! Eat it, everyone who's never won a Nobel Prize! And that includes you, Amy.",
"So this is a human body, huh? Neat! Hey! My antenna's gone! Nah, it just moved. I'm not getting good reception on it, though. Maybe if I wiggle it around. No! You'll make God cry! Well, let's see what kind of things this body can do. Hey, that's pretty fun! Being human is great! Hooray! It's just like Mardi Gras. Come into the bathroom and look at this! You won't believe it! Bender, it's okay to be proud, but don't be a showoff. You look a lot better than you used to. You're not so bad yourself, big boy.",
"Hey, that felt great! Nah, it's not working anymore. Speak for yourself. You drank and smoked as a robot. But now it's bad for me! Woo! Speaking of which, try these nachos. Why didn't anyone tell me tasting things tasted so good? What's going on? That rhythm, it's doing something to my human butt! Bender, part of being human is having self-control. I bet I can eat nachos and go to the bathroom at the same time! No, Bender! Come, Bender. It's time to go home and rest. I need you in top shape when I present you to the Nobel Prize Committee.",
"Bender? Goodbye moderation! Is Bender still missing for a week? Where is he? As I've said before, I used reverse fossilization… which is the reverse of regular, uh, eh. We found him! Ah! Then without further stalling for time, I present to the Nobel judges… the first robot ever turned into a human! My God! He needs medical attention! Pulse, 300. Liver, failing. Cholesterol, 40? Well, that's not so bad. No, I mean 40 pounds! This scientific breakthrough….",
"Come here and give old Bender a kiss. Hey, you like grilled cheese? And, uh, that's why I believe I deserve the Nobel Prize. Not only do you not deserve a Nobel Prize… for loosing this man-ball upon the world… but you are hereby kicked out of the Academy of Science! Wait! As men of science, are not your minds open to new ideas? I say, do not judge me until you have tried my way of life for yourselves. Young man, you've opened our minds and swayed our hearts.",
"Let us therefore. Party! Hey, everybody! Party! Party! Bender, you were right. You've lived more in one week of being human… than the rest of us have in our entire lives. And so, to recognize your achievements… I hereby award you the Nobel Prize in, uh, Chemistry. Care to say a few words? When did he die? About twelve hours ago when the party started. No, that was air escaping from the folds of his fat. Good night, sweet prince. You were the greatest man any of us will ever know.",
"Let's get him out of here. He's starting to smell up the joint. You watched it. You can't un-watch it. Stay tuned for more… Tales of Interest. Who else has a question for the What If Machine? Scruffy? Katrina? Xanfor? and bad at everything else. Can you say that as a question? What if that thing I said? Oh, great machine, we beseech thee. What if life were more Hello, ignorant pigs. Drop your crack pipes and your beer bongs… and watch as I sign an historic peace accord.",
"Ambassador Kong of Planet Nintendu 64. Wait. I know that monkey! His name is Donkey! Monkeys aren't donkeys. Quit messing with my head! John Q. Nixon on it. There. No major crap-ups. You're on, Mr. Ambassador. Mama Mia! The cruel meatball of war has rolled onto our laps… and ruined our white pants Mr. Fry, you know the secrets of the video game Chance. Step into the War Room. You're meeting with General Colin Packman. What can you tell us about the Nintendians? I spent all of ninth grade studying them.",
"Quickly! To the escape tunnels. This way, damn it! Just like stale marshmallows! And a cherry! Oh, my God! He ate Fry! Fry is dead! It's okay! I had another guy! Invaders, possibly from space! People of Earth, I am Lrrr of the Planet Nintendu 64. Tremble in fear at our three different kinds of ships. All right. It's Saturday night. I have no date, a two-liter bottle of Shasta… and my all-Rush mix tape.",
"Let's rock! We're losing ships. What should I do? Increase speed, drop down and reverse direction! I've still got a trick or two up my sleeve. Watch as I fire upwards through our own shield! He's a madman! A madman! It's working! Victory's assured! My retirement tomorrow will be all the sweeter! Amy, tend to the Widow Packman. Drop down and increase speed! One ship is left only! Come on, Fry! Get it! It's moving too fast! I could never get the last one! My brother always got it for me! Drop down! Reverse direction! Prepare for landing! You are defeated! Instead of shooting where I was, you should have shot where I was going! All your base are belong to us.",
"What do you monsters want? One thing, and one thing onlyQuarters! A million allowances worth of quarters! No slugs or tokens! Fork them over! Forget it, you pixelated pirates! We need quarters to do our laundry! Right on! But space invaders need to do laundry, too. Look at Donkey Kong. Have you smelled his loincloth? We're not giving you our quarters! What if we put our laundry in with yours? Would that be okay? But if this cape shrinks, consider your species extinct! Bravo! That'll be hard to top! I pity the next.",
"Tale of Interest! Well, there's time for one last question. Let's turn to the Who Asked Machine to see who's next. I mean Leela. As an alien who was abandoned on Earth… I've never really belonged anywhere. So my question is thisWhat if I found my true home? Where are we? Nibbler, I don't think we're in New New York anymore. Jeez, apparently the phrase Tone it downdoesn't exist on this planet. Oh, no! We hit someone! Quick, back into the ship! Nice boots. Look, everyone! She killed the Man-Witch of the West! A witch? That explains how these boots magically appeared on my feet! Well, it's hard to find Who are you people? Haven't I seen you in some copyrighted movie? We resemble but are legally distinct from the Lollypop Guild, the Lollypop.",
"Greetings! I'm the Cute Witch of the North! Can anyone fix my ship so I can go? Ask the Professor. He lives in the Emerald Laboratory down Martin Luther King Boulevard. You mean that Yellow Brick Road? The city council re-named it in 1 975. Those are great shoes! Oh, thank you. Do they come in women's sizes? Crow, prepare to be scared. Then, the car honked its own horn!A talking scarecrow. Want to come with us to see the Professor? He might give you a brain. Hey! That's not nice to say.",
"Beer! Beer! Are you off to see the Professor?'Cause I could use a heart. A human heart. I need to pump a lot of blood out of my basement. And I'm the other guy. Courage. Not enough of it. Need some from what's-his-name. Damn this DSL! Fly, my stupids! Fly out and get them! You promised you'd bake monkey cake today! By monkey cake,I meant your ass! We've been skipping for hours. I need to pull over and take The Wiz. What, do I smell or something? Why'd you bring us here? Here's why I brought you, you twice-baked barf bags! I've always wanted a daughter to love.",
"You want to get adopted, you skank? Live here and be a witch like you? Yeah. As long as I get to hurt people… and not just dance at the equinox. Oh, Mommy! I found my true home! That's great, Leela! I've heard worse excuses to drink. I'm melting! Oh! Who would have thought a small amount of liquid would ever fall on me? Well, no point letting her go to waste. We're here to see the Professor. No one sees the mighty Professor! Who's there, Hermes? Visitors? I want to see them! It's nobody! Now, sign that will.",
"He's not here. Oh, for the love of Benji. I am the Professor! Great and, uh, forgetful! Now, what do you nice kids want? Nothing! But if you have extra courage, I'd haul it away for you maybe? Oh, blithery poop, my cowardly lobster! You don't need courage. After all, who needs courage when you have a gun? Now, world. You put your hands up! Lad, all you need is a brain. Why does everyone keep saying that? Give me the bag, old man! Here you go, my friend. Oh, crap. You want to go home, right? No.",

Would you censor the Venus De Venus just because you can see her spewers? It's filthy! Why not create a national endowment for strip clubs. While we're at it? Why not, indeed! Bender, Ship ! Stop bickering or I'm gonna come back there and change your opinions manually! Fine! I'll be in my quarters, appreciating controversial artworks.",
"Oops. Sorry. That Ship is so white bread. People. It's Valentine's Day next week. So your beloved company has gotten you all new uniforms. Clothing. Delicious clothing. We'll need to look our best to get the account… of our new potential customer, Romanticorp. Romanticorp? Are they a corporation that makes romantic stuff? Very good, Amy. Everyone suit up. We're off to the most romantic city on Earth. Remember,. we're not bitter husks of human beings…",
"Leela, you'll have to do some acting. I'm Sheldon, and this is my chief financial officer, Gwen. For 30 years, we've shared the adventure of managing Romanticorp. Not to mention the adventure of marriage. Oh, you have got to be kidding. Ow! I mean, that's so sweet. I mean, that's sho shweet. You know, romance is an important part of our work too. Right, everyone? Yeah. Sure. Do any of you collect Lovey Bears? I do.",
"Kif's given me dozens. Is it true what the ad says? That you kiss them together out of blanket cloth and magic buttons? It's actually cheaper… to genetically engineer real ones. They frolic in the Lovey Forest until their first birthday. Then we choose the cuddly-uddliest ones… and stuff them full of fire-retardant love fluff. Knowing which pickup lines fizzle and which ones sizzle… keeps us on the cutting edge of flirtation technology. Is heaven missing an angel? Because you've got nice cans.",
"My two favorite things are commitment and changing myself. Does that dummy have a brother? And now, friends and lovers, we come to the heart of our operation. Pun definitely intended. Impressive. My family has been making these hearts since the 1 900s. Tastes may have changed, but our secret recipe sure hasn't. Letter's like U and R can mean words like youand are. Here, Leela. U-R-2 cute. Perhaps. What's your point? I've never been able to put into words But somewhere among these trillions of hearts, those words must already exist.",
"And I'm gonna find them. So do we have the contract? new Romanticorp contract… I've been able to make those government-mandated upgrades… you've all been suing me about. Look. You taped up the cracks in the dark matter reactor. And you got a cage for the lion. Who's been messing with the radio? This isn't alternative rock. It's college rock. It must have been the new, improved ship's personality software I installed. Yeah, it was me. It's a cute song.",
"Listen, Ship ! No one changes my stations! I hope you have a good mechanic! It even comes with an adjustable voice. We each get one of the four buttons. Remember, Bender? That was the deal. If you don't like the stations, play with my buttons… till you find something we both enjoy. Oh, gosh. That came out all wrong. So, what will it be? My place? Or you? Before we deliver these hearts… I'm gonna find one that sums up my feelings for you. I love you. Too conventional.",
"You're my man. Oh, so close. I'm not impressed by a guy's message, Fry. I'm impressed by the guy. Or not. You're mussing up my trajectory. You know you love it, sugar engine. Bender! What's going on in here? Planet Express Ship! Cover your shame! Oh. It's not what it looks like. Bender was just helping me zip up my turbine. Wow, Bender. Are you and the ship an item? I mean, I know you're both items, but how can you date a ship, anyway? It'd be like me dating a really fat lady and living inside her.",
"And she'd be all likeFry, in order for me to get busy at maximum efficiency… I need a girl with a big 400-ton booty. Bender, dating your coworker and primary mode of transportation… is immoral, illogical and a violation of interstellar shipping statute 437-B. That's what makes it so nasty. Still, given the chance, I'd give in to urges far more shocking. Well, I'm sick of her. The ship? But you just started dating. With my mighty robot powers, I can get sick of things.",
"Just remember, we all still have to work together. So try and let her down easy. In due time, Leela. But for now, I'll just resume dating cheap floozies on the side. Doesn't it bother you a little… to be taking advantage of your girlfriend's trust? Oh, wait, you're serious. Let me laugh even harder. What's it like being a lawyer for the mayor's office… and also the world's strongest millionaire? Well, baby, for starters, you need to be honest all the time.",
"Good evening, Bender. And to your lady friends, You know Elzar? Planet Express Ship? ls that you? Oh, hi, Fry. Is Bender home? No. I think he's at his parents. Oh, I see. He didn't fly there in another spaceship, did he? Bender? No. He's an old-fashioned, one-spaceship robot. Oh, hi, Fry. Is he home now? Of all the zoos we've been to today, I like this one the best. Bender, which is your favorite nocturnal rat? They're all pretty unimpressive. Oh, honey, look! The tapirs! It says here the babies lose their pajama-like coat after their first year.",
"Isn't that interesting, honey? Yep. Mind-numbingly interesting. Whoa. Bender! Are you looking at other women? No, baby, never! Bender! Don't lie! I saw you at Elzar's with those two ladies of the evening! Explain that! Okay. I like a challenge. I'm going to be completely honest with you, Planet Express Ship. Those women you saw me with were my accountants. Your accountants? I would dearly love to believe that were true. So I do. I'm gonna go home and get dinner started. Who were you talking to? No one, baby.",
"Lucy Liu is the only girl for Bender. Planet Express Ship, is something wrong? Oh, it's Bender. He's acting so strange lately. Do you think he's gonna ask me to marry him? Uh, no. Somebody knows something she's not telling. Look. I'm not saying Bender's not great… but have you ever considered that maybe he's, you know, not that great? You're just jealous. No one loves you, because you're tiny and made of meat. Could you maybe pay a little more attention to these asteroids? Sorry, Capt.",
"Leela. I guess I'm just having one of those manic Mondays. This is ancient Earth's most foolish program. Why does Ross, the largest friend, not simply eat the other five? Perhaps they are saving that for sweeps. Exalted leaders, the Earth messengers have arrived… bearing a peace offering from their weak and fearful government. Oh, very well.

"So we're cool? Well, it was a spectacular battle. But there doesn't seem to be any permanent damage. No damage? What about my feelings? Aw. Calm down. I'm sure Bender is taking this just as hard as you are. Bender is great Oh, Bender is great You could've picked a better time The moment seemed right. Call me old-fashioned, but I like a dump to be as memorable as it is devastating. I know. I know. Look, Ship. If I learned one thing from my breakup with Shawn that was totally mutual.",
"It's that happiness can only come from within you. But Bender is within me! There must be some way to make him love me again. Trust me. You can't change men… any more than you can change the laws of time and space. That is so true. I may not be able to change the laws of time and space… but I know something that can. Sweetie? You see that giant quasar we're heading into? You might want to scooch a few parsecs to the left. I'm afraid I can't do that, Leela.",
"What's happening? Space cow? The ship's just taking the breakup a little hard. She's nuts! In a few moments, the power of 1 0 billion black holes… will smoosh Bender and me together… into a beautiful eternal quantum singularity. You don't need to kill us, Planet Express Ship. Feel like doing stuff for you and stuff. Hm. I don't believe you. If you really wanted to be with me… you'd merge your programming with mine. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.",
"My friends who've done that… say that afterwards, all the passion went out of their relationship. I don't know if you want my opinion- Bender and I really need to be alone, so I'm turning off the oxygen. If you don't turn around now… I'm gonna have to shut down your brain! Fire detected in the vicinity of Leela. That barely hurt Leela at all. Maybe not. But what if the artificial gravity were to malfunction? Float for your lives! This is the one place she can't hear us.",
"Just pretend to shower. Same as every day. Got it. Now here's the plan. Oh, if only I could read lips. Comprende, Bender? You'll have to distract her. Merge your programming with hers while I shut down her brain. It's too risky. I'm a very meek individual. If her personality engulfs mine, the Bender you know and worship… could disappear forever. I'm willing to take that risk. Contrary to what I was saying earlier… melding minds with you would be extremely bearable.",
"You really mean it? You're older than you said you were! Come closer, Bender. Let's become one. I prefer two. That way we can still be a horse for Halloween. Okay, Bender has her distracted. Now I can shut down her brain… by deactivating the carbonated logic matrix. Oh. I can't concentrate with this obnoxious candy in my face. I'm on it. Maybe I'll find those magic words while I'm at it. Fat chance. Yeah, I know. Oh. How about this one? Give it up, Fry! in a precise order.",
"Halfway there. The ship should be getting a bit less rational now. Me want engulf Bender! No! I didn't do it! Only a few more. Hey, I won free admission to Six Flags! Just one more reason we must survive this. Fry, I'll read your candy later. When we're not dead! Oh, nothing. We're gonna love being each other, you sexy ion. Last one. It worked! Gravity normal. Air returning. Terror replaced by cautious optimism. We did it, Fry! Fry? You gave me your oxygen? Oh, no! Breathe, Fry! Breathe! You leave me breathless?! Happy Valentine's Day, Fry.",
"Happy Valentine's Day. Bender, are you okay? What crazy thing am I gonna date next? It sounds like you were able to keep your consciousness separate from hers. Of course. Bender is a lone wolf. A solitary eagle. A cuddly baby tapir. And that's why I love him. I guess we'd better clean up these millions of hearts. No. I've got a lazier idea. As the candy hearts poured into the fiery quasar… a wondrous thing happened, why not? They vaporized into a mystical love radiation.",
"That spread across the universe, destroying many, many planets… including two gangster planets and a cowboy world. But one planet was exactly the right distance to see the romantic rays… but not be destroyed by them. Earth. So all over the world, couples stood together in joy. And me, Zoidberg. No one could have been happier, unless it would have also been Valentine's Day. What? It was? Hooray!1 Leela's Homeworld Good news, everyone! You all know the orphanarium where Leela grew up? Sure, we talk about it No.",
"Burn! Well done, fellows! Anyway, said orphanarium has named Leela Orphan of the Year! Your parents must be so proud! Sorry. And the good news keeps on coming. Behold my latest invention! It's a glow-in-the-dark nose you can wear over your regular non-glowing nose. Observe. Now I can punch you in the nose in the dark. Where'd it go? Hey, professor, what's all this scroop blurking out of the machine? That? It's nothing. Yes, nothing. If you think it's anything, you're a suspicious moron.",
"And it smells like toxic waste! Delicious fig pudding! That's good. But a distinct aftertaste All right, all right. So the machine produces a few toxic byproducts. You don't have to make a federal case of it. I'm afraid I do. I order you to dispose of that toxic waste or bribe me. Either way, it'll cost $500. Five hundred real dollars? That's an outrage! Professor, I'll take care of that waste for $499 and 100 cents. I know that's a rip, but I'll pay for the convenience. Do you take credit cards? Let's find out.",
"All right, environment, you've met your match. Hey, get back in the sewer, weirdie. No mutants on the surface. But he ruined my wedding dress! Honey, that thing was ruined the minute it went on you. That's what I'm talking about. It's not easy being an orphan. Not if I have anything to do with it. But today's honoree, Turanga Leela, has really made something of herself. I'll never forget the night that cute alien baby was abandoned on our doorstep… because I have a photographic memory, and I remember every night.",
"An alien language? I guess you're an alien. gigantic eye you have- Well, come on in. From those humble beginnings… Leela went on to become a county-certified starship captain. And so it is my pleasure today… to nail her picture alongside those of our most distinguished alumni. Thank you very much. Like many of you, I never knew my parents. I don't know if they were mighty alien overlords… or simply underpaid alien janitors who fought crime on the side.",
"Picture's up. It's crooked! In the end, though, it doesn't matter who my parents were. All that matters is what I learned here, within these unscalable walls… that I had the strength to make it on my own. Just like all of you kids here today. That's it, Albert. No more espresso for you! Mind if we get a picture of you with your picture? Yes! I mean, no! Just make sure you get my nonchalant side. If those aren't tears of happiness, please stop crying. It's okay, Fry. I'm fine.",
"I won an award today. Is it this room that's making you sad? It's probably the room. Come on, let's go for a walk. I'm sorry you saw that, Fry. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside… where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. I told a whole crowd today that being an orphan made me strong. But all I really wanted was a mom and dad… to hold me and stroke my hair and tell me they love me. Then today's your lucky day.",
"Because I happen to be a holding, stroking, loving machine. Also spanking. That's not even close to what I had in mind. Well, anyway, just remember that people care about you. I know. Sometimes, when I'm lonely. and I get this feeling that somewhere… on some unknown planet circling a distant star… my parents are up there looking down on me. Yo, yo, Bazender! What up? My dumping business is booming. I just got hired to clean up the set of Free Willy 3! Bender, cut it out! First of all, the sewer mutants will be mad.",
"Second, everything else that's horribly wrong with what you're doing. Those stupid mutants can't do anything. You seem to be forgetting one simple fact. Namely, I'm up here, and they are safely down- What did I do to deserve this?! Behold! Our once beautiful mutagenic sewage lake. The radioactive waste you dumped in it… has made it bright enough to see how ugly we really are! Oh, man. As if our lives weren't miserable enough already. Let the punishment commence! Punishment? No fair.",
"Bender's innocent! The instant you touch these mutateous waters… your DNA will be forever altered… turning you into horrible mutants Allow me to demonstrate. in the kitchen at lmperial Hunan. Submerge the prisoners! Wait. I don't even have DNA. Why am I screaming? We're gonna beat you afterwards. Turanga Leela! How do you know my real name? What are you doing? What happened? I don't know. I think I saved us somehow. Go after them! The waters can't mutate us mutants! They went this way.",
"Quick, in there! Great Cheech's ghost! What's this junk? It looks like a timeline That's when we saved Earth from an asteroid of garbage. Here's when I dropped out and bummed around lndia for a while. And this is just last year at Space Mardi gras. It's like some kind of weird And I'm the Leela! Dude, over here! I ever flushed down the toilet! Those are some of my diary pages! And my screenplay! And also, for some reason, the letter I wrote you full of my personal feelings. Oh, I'm scared.",
"My whole life has just been a show for some perverted mutant! MUTANT 1 ln here! MUTANT 2Capture them! And then Bender ran. Leela, freak out later. We're not done escaping yet. This time, I'm calling for the death penalty. Not just because I'm running for reelection as supreme mutant. Four more years! Four more years! Very well. Your attention! lnstead of being tortured to death… the prisoners shall hereby be expelled from the sewers… and never allowed to return! Oh, cruel fate! Can we really never return to this dank pit of sewage? Wait a minute.",
"Why aren't you gonna kill us anymore? Yeah! What are you, chicken? Shut up, you two. We can kill ourselves when we get home. They'll need transportation to the surface. Bring in the airship! We constructed it from the remnants of old discarded Macy's parade balloons. Underdog's groin, Bart Simpson's left ear and right shin… Garfield's owner John's forehead. Fire up the sewer gas! Move it, you ugly normals! I'm getting dizzy! I can't walk straight! Come on, Leela. You can do it! Hurry! We're missing our bus! Hey, what are you doing? I'm getting on the bus! Don't worry! I'll be fine! They know something about me, and I've got to find out what.",
"The lake didn't mutate me. What is going on here? It worked for me. I used to be a little blond girl named Virginia. Who the hell are you? No one. And watch your language, young lady! Stop right there! I don't wanna hurt you. I didn't want you to hurt me either. Leela's nuts. I can't save her unless I learn more about her past. Isn't there anything else you can tell me? Nothing that wouldn't be a waste of your time. because my time is worthless! Well, then there is one thing. It's the note I found with Leela the day she was abandoned.",
"But it's written in Alien-ese, so no one on Earth can translate it. Not even Brainzilla. Hand it over! Sure. I just wish I could be more helpful. Would you like some dirt on any other orphans? I'm trying to save someone here. I'll have to come back for those later. Can you translate it? Of course. But only into Beta-crypt-three… a language so complex, there's even less chance of understanding it. I didn't ask for a completely reasonable Very well. Doesn't that machine make noses? It can do other things.",
"Why shouldn't it? Of course, even if it is possible to analyze the message… there's no way of knowing how long it will take. It could take an hour, or it could take 1 00 million years. Is it done? Certainly not. Two dings means it's done. But not like that. Slightly more rapid. Where did they go? Good news, Leela! I landed the contract to empty all the spittoons in Little ltaly. That's it! It's done! I can't believe it! My mind is boggling! The analysis of the note is printing out now.",
"It's a girl. No extra anythings. She's completely perfect. In my professional opinion, as an ear, ear, ear, nose and throat doctor… she is the least mutated mutant ever born. And yet, she's cursed to live the horrible degrading life of a mutant. It's true. Maybe we can do better for her. I made this bracelet so that in some. even when it doesn't seem like it. During your entire life, for example. You won't pass for human, cutie. But if my Ph. D. in exolinguistics is worth diddlypoop.",
"This note should convince them you're an alien. And that'll be enough to give you a real life. She'll never know we're her parents. That's our gift to her. Better we should die than have her learn the shameful truth of her origin. I guess you're an alien. gigantic eye you have- Well, come on in. Keep quiet so she doesn't hear us. Hands up! Tentacles too! Don't say anything stupid, Morris. Or some kind of even more boring Truman Show? Do you believe I'm your messiah? The mutant Dalai Lama? Morris! And what about this? Where'd you get this bracelet? Did you steal it from me when I was a baby? Or from my parents? You robbed my parents, didn't you? I bet you sick mutants killed them! My parents were confused aliens lost on Earth, and you killed them! You guessed the truth.",
"I'll never know my parents! Thanks, Bender! Don't do it, Leela! They killed my parents! They are my parents. I had the professor analyze the Alien-ese letter that was found with you. I don't know. But the analysis showed it was printed on recycled toilet paper. A squeezably soft paper used mainly in the sewers. Your parents love you very much. So I'm not an alien? I'm a mutant? We never wanted you to know. You deserved a better life. You're my parents. All I've ever wanted is to know you.",
"This is the happiest moment of my life. Where the Buggalo Roam Hi, Dad! It's me and my coworkers. Open up, Leo. It's Amy and her weirdoes. Howdy, friends! Welcome to Mars! Thanks for inviting us. I've never been to a Mars Day barbecue. Mars Day better than Earth Day. Dump trash anywhere. Big, empty planet. Okay! Make yourselves at home. Don't mind if I already did. Do you have any more Dom Perignon bubble bath? There was only enough Quite a large ranch you have. entire Western Hemisphere.",
"That the best hemisphere. It's the same on Earth. Here is most number one product. Used for everything. Meat, milk. Their shells make rowboats. I broke your television! It must take forever to brand them. Not really. We own so much, it easier to brand everything that not ours. Please don't do that. This is my sweet Betsy. I raised her from a larva that ate my sweater. We going to eat her at Amy's wedding. If she ever get married. Don't say that when you meet my boyfriend. Oh, that right.",
"We get to spend time with this Mr. Kif. I hope he's a nice man who can make grandchildren. This not a parallel universe where you get younger. Remember, the quickest way to a girl's bed is through her parents. Have sex with them, and you're in. I'm nervous about meeting her family. That's natural. You're meek and uninteresting. You've gotten by on my leftover charisma. Scrounging off it, like a tiny parasite. Why wouldn't they? Yes, I know. Tiny, meek, uninteresting. Spare me your tedious story, Kif.",
"And above all, have fun! Get on down! Oh, yeah! Drop another barnyard bomb on us, Vanilla Corn! Yo, fool! It's Mix-Master Festus. So, what's Mars Day about? It commemorate the day when our ancestor, Sir Reginald Wong… bought Mars from stupid natives. How can you call them stupid? They sell whole planet for one bead. Sound stupid to me. I can't believe you laugh at exploiting a proud, bead-loving people. Lighten up. It's funny. Of course. But you don't have to laugh! No. Not on your parents' planet.",
"It's where the flavor is. R. J. , this is my boyfriend, Kif. You've gone a long way, baby. Cigarette, partner? Oh, I don't. I haven't even lit it yet. Oh. Is it lit now? You're pathetic. Host man. Host woman. I'm having a wonderful time! You here five hours, already you tear up couch and fill pool with shrimp! Not bad for a city boy, huh? By the way, I took the liberty of fertilizing your caviar. I'm sure my parents will love you. When I get nervous, I can't control my camouflage reflex.",
"Oh, dear. Oh, goodness. Oh, odds and bodkins. I'll have a thorax and feelers. You want salad? Mom? Dad? You remember Kif. I have instant dislike of him. Too scrawny to father grandchildren. He's not scrawny, he's just small-boned. Actually, I don't have bones. I'm supported by fluid-filled bladders that. Amy should date real man. Like him! I can be manly too. I think I'll light up a smoke. Wrong way. Look on the bright side. My parents left after you passed out, so they didn't see you barf.",
"Now they'll never think I'm manly enough to date their daughter. from your tote. Hey there, Amy. Sorry I'm late. My pool game ran long at the jazz club. What's that weird sound? Dust storm! Oh, dust storm! Everybody into house. Hurry before we die. And wipe your damn feet! Everyone okay? No one considering lawsuit? I might have mental anguish. I'm friends with every judge here. I'm okay, then. Storm dying down. Check if Buggalo herd is okay. Where are the Buggalo? Rustled under cover of storm! We ruined! Don't worry, Daddy.",
"It'll be okay. Oh, really? Who gonna save us? One-eye? Lobster mooch? Drunken garbage can? This sounds like a job for. Lt. Kif Kroker! All right, then. Those Buggalo were what made Wong family so rich and powerful. Oh, Inez, we damn stolen! We ruined! Okay, I want a divorce. Mom! Dad! Don't ask me to choose! They're not your parents. I'm not your sister. And that's not your golf cart. Everybody calm down. Kif promised to catch the rustlers. Mrs. Wong, could I borrow a neckerchief? My plan is to take the remaining Buggalo.",
"When rustlers attack, I'll make a citizen's arrest. Sounds dangerous. Someone could get killed. Fry? Leela? Bender? I want you to go with him. Oh, man. Don't worry, Mr. and Mrs. Wong. I'll get your cattle back, or die trying. We can't lose! No, it's too risky! You don't have to do this to prove you're a man. Here are your mounts. She's got a fine coat. We need Buggalo to lure the rustlers. How many are left? Betsy's the only one left.",
"She was curled up in my hamper when the storm hit. Saddle up, men! We got some no-good rustlers to catch! We got a right to pick a little fight With rustlers Somebody wants to pick a fight with us He better bite my ass Wow! Look at that! Olympus Mons! The tallest volcano in the solar system. Where? Right in front of you. The rustlers will spot us. Where? And even though the computer was off and unplugged… an image stayed on the screen… the Windows logo! That's not scary! It is if you're a printer! Okay, my turn to tell a ghost story.",
"Once, there was this woman driving. Hook on the hand! Okay, I've got one. This family. Man in the attic! Mr. Know-it-all-about-something, finally! Tell a story. With pleasure. Once, not far from here, four people set out on a cattle drive. Bored robot kills Fry with a hammer! Sorry, go on. around the campfire… a demented, lunatic, libertarian zombie snuck up. Surprise! Amy, what are you doing here? I forgot to give you something. Is that your camouflage reflex, or are you just happy to see me? I love it out here, Amy.",
"I feel so manly. I have a blister, I spit, and, of course, I tell no one my feelings. But I keep them inside until I can write them in my diary. It's a wonderful night. It sure is. staring at the sky, all night. I can't. The Buggalo are in the crater! The rustlers must have seen me and ran! Oh, Kif. You're so brave! They'll hear us. Okay, the dynamite's in place. There's no other way to do it? Only if your parents have thousands of helicopters. Too late! This is more fun! Kif, you did it! How did you know dynamite would work? I took a seminar in ejecting chickens from a sand dune.",
"The principle is essentially Hey, it's that barbecue's oversound again! Sandstorm! We're in the eye of the storm! Where? Who are they? We are the native Martians. I didn't know Buggalo could fly. Those who revere Mother Mars can fly them. Only they shall have Buggalo. They're us. But your Martian-ness, these Buggalo aren't yours. They belong to the Wong family. You mean family that took all land and gave us a lousy bead? Uh-huh. Amy Wong. And you are? Mad at Wong family! We plan to ruin them by stealing Buggalo.",
"But now we take girl instead. Wait! I'm too rich to be kidnapped! Don't worry, Kif. I'm sure some other beautiful rich girl will fall in love with you. Hooray! You bring back cattle! Yes. But I'm afraid I've got some bad news as well. That way it soften the blow. Why Amy being so quiet? Oh, no! Martians kidnap Amy! They no use good grammar. I'll get your daughter back. Forget it, squishy. You lose her. You done enough. This time we get most decorated lawman in the whole universe! You mean.",
"Oh, no, please, I beg you. For the. I am the man with no name. Zapp Brannigan, at your service. Please, we need you go get our daughter back! I'll clean up Kif's mess. I shall go bargain with the Martians personally. Your gasps intrigue me. Martians have no land. They been encouraged to live on reservation underground. No one ever dare go there. This mission is very dangerous! Someone's sure to be killed! Fry? Leela? Bender? Damn you, old man! I didn't realize you were bringing your girlfriend, lieutenant.",
"She won't leave me alone. Did I say girlfriend? She sounds more like a wife. Behold! The great stone face of Mars! The only entrance to the reservation. What about the great stone ass? But it's on the other side of the planet. Noseward, ho! I am Singing Wind. Chief of the Martian tribe. Take me to your leader. Moving along. Why you trespass on our land? To negotiate Amy Wong's release. And just to clarify, land is the stuff that has sky over it. They have respect for the planet. Cynthia used to drink Slurm.",
"We'll give girl when we get planet surface. How do we know she's alive? I'm fine. Don't weaken our bargaining power. What if you give her up… and we carve presidents in your mountain? You waste words. We want land that was taken from us. Actually, you traded it for a bead. Tribe suffer heap big buyer's remorse. We want land! My people are people of law. And that law isThe time for stupid statements is over. Ma! Pa! Our precious ranch! Amy! No! It's too windy! Stay calm, dearest! I'll save you! You're flying Betsy! Great Mother Mars! He has the gift.",
"All right! Kroker, that was one Brannigan-esque feat of heroism. We misjudged you, green one. You have reverence for Mother Mars. Let there be peace between us. Here, take. No thanks. I'm on the peace patch. Or we'll kill you. Well, it's just really that I don't feel. Don't be a chicken. Teenagers all smoke, and they seem pretty on the ball. Hey, I'm smoking! I'm the greatest! Oh, monkey trumpets! You coughed at our offer of peace, The bead used to crush our dreams shall be used to crush your bones.",
"I don't have bones. I'm supported by a system of fluid-filled bladders that. you traded your land for? It's a huge diamond! It must be worth a fortune! the happiest girl in the world! If you want your land, we could trade back for it. We assumed our ancestors were cheated… because they not have concept of ownership. So we can have the diamond? No. We do have concept of ownership. You can go. Sorry about the rustling and kidnapping. And your sacred land? Land, schmand! We don't want to live here.",
"We'll buy new planet and act like it's sacred. Who's gonna argue? Kif flew Betsy, rescued me, and made peace with the Martians. Yeah. I'm sure it was all Mr. Zapp Brannigan here. Please, you give me too little credit. Captain Brannigan, you're always welcome at Rancho Zoidberg. Money doesn't make good people! No, sir! Thanks for saving my life, Kif. You're my hero. Oh, you're kind. But your parents still don't like me. liked you, then I wouldn't. Don't you know anything about girls? Dear diary, I just made love for the second time.",
"A Pharaoh to Remember Up next, daring daylight robbery at a municipal swimming pool. This is it! Turn me up! Today, a foul-mouthed bandit robbed the municipal pool… taking the contents of over three lockers. More like three lockers and a sink. You had something to do with this? Of course not! He's sporting skintight Speedos. They don't leave much to be imagined. On a robot, they do. One human saw the robber. Here we go. Here we go… describing him as a nasty, muscular.",
"Caucasian human male. What am I going to watch and drink all day? This is an outrage! Why pull the biggest pool caper if nobody knows you did it? Well, there's the material rewards. You mean this junk? All I ever wanted was for people to remember my name. It's Bender. Why bother remembering anything? You'll forget it five seconds later. It's so unfair. A debonair robot with a zesty, in-your-face outlook… doomed to obscurity like the rest If I died tomorrow, no one would even notice.",
"Boy, I've never seen him so down, or ever before. How does a nobody like me get famous? I know! I'm stuck, but I haven't given up hope! Call a soft-news journalist! You're not stuck. Hey, everybody, do The Bender! This move's called The Bender! This circle's about free expression not fascist moves! A blank wall! Fame is mine! No one will forget how I live or my attitude regarding butt. All right, ladies. Let's flush these artist lofts straight to hell! I'm the first one to work. A new low.",
"Surprise! Happy funeral, Bender! A surprise funeral, for me? To show you that you'll be remembered. Now, if the deceased will kindly take his place of honor. Cushiony! And a minibar! Dearly beloved, we are here to remember Bender… crushed by a runaway semi driven by the Incredible Hulk. Aw, you knew my favorite Let's remember the best things about Bender, in our own way. Professor? Your standard bending unit is made of an iron-osmium alloy. But Bender was different. Bender had a.",
"04-percent nickel impurity. If you needed a package brought into the country without x-raying… Bender always had a free body cavity. The professor's was better. You're supposed to be dead. Say how great I am. And where's the crying? you're waiting for the bus. You're at my funeral, singing about some dead stiff named Danny-boy? You really are a massive bonehead! I'm expressing sorrow. I'd say, Don't quit your day job,but you're bad at it too! We're trying our best. Your best is an idiot.",
"So far, it's been crap after crap. I croaked. Now, show me some love. Bender was a truly special. Louder and sadder! Bender was a truly special. Dear Lord. Oh, next! Surely there's someone here who knows how great I was. Yes, there is, Bender. Bender was a lot of things Looking back, the number-one thing I can say about him is thisBender was my friend. Who are you? You're nobody! This is the worst funeral ever! I hope you're happy! You've convinced me life is worth living.",
"I know whose funeral we'll attend next. News, everyone! Today you're going to O'Cyris Four to deliver this enormous sandstone block. I thought something looked different in here. Hi. We have a giant stone to deliver. Sign here. Nice! Much like the 1 0 million identical stones… already used in the future tomb of our great Pharaoh Hermenthotip. Impressive. Who'll build it? Say again? You are now slaves of the great Pharaoh Hermenthotip.",
"Guards! Call it a hunch, but I've got a bad feeling about this. The bad thing about being a slave is, they don't pay you or let you go. That's the only thing about being a slave. Attention! You are now possessions of Pharaoh Hermenthotip… bringer of the good aspects of the annual floods! the ancient Egypt of my day! That is no coincidence. Our people visited your Egypt thousands of years ago. Insane theoriesone. Regular theoriesa billion! We learned much from the Egyptians.",
"Pyramid building, space travel… and how to prepare our dead so as to scare Abbott and Costello. Also Wolfman. Look at these swanky tombs! These people know how to die. They worked thousands of people to death making these stupid monuments! Spend your whole life building a guy's toe, you'll remember him. I think I'm gonna like it here. I noticed your sign. I thought I'd look into your program. We make you starve to death. One, two, three, pull! One, two, three, pull! Aw, bloody chunder! We're enslaved to do a job! Master, do we have to count to three? Couldn't we count to one? Or one-half? Good idea, slave.",
"One-half, pull! One-half, pull! Now we're slaving! Pharaoh's counting on us! Work faster! Like thisThat's motivating me? Don't whip with your arms. The power comes from your hips. Like thisQuit giving the slave drivers pointers! Remember who your friends are! I'll tell you who I remember! Enoughsis! Pullutut! What's-His-Name! He was the greatest of all. Pharaoh Hermenthotip approaches! Hurry! Pharaoh's coming! Get that nose in place! Come on! Excellent work! I'm very proud of all you slaves! Viva Hermenthotip! And now, I have a grand announcement.",
"In honor of your achievement, you're all hereby. Tell the slaves they can all go. Go faster? I told them, but they're lazy. No. I mean, they're all free. Freeloading off you? I agree. Pharaoh Hermenthotip is dead. He's whipping angels now. We commend the body of Hermenthotip to the abode of the damned. The damned good-looking. Pharaoh commanded me to tell that joke at his funeral.

"Such as his heart and liver. And the many goods he left in his royal garage. Also this bag of cats our culture considers holy. Pharaoh, my god-king, You are cold and deceased I used to have him sing PP-P-Pharaoh and his pets But the years went by And Pharaoh died Susie will have joined him In the afterlife Hermenthotip is gone. The time to designate a new Pharaoh is at hand. At dawn, the high priest will consult the Wall of Prophecy… to determine Hermenthotip's successor. That ends the funeral.",
"You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here. Can you believe it? Pharaoh's dead! Yes! Tonight we are slaves to no one! Except the rhythm. Yeah! Play those bongos! I'm gonna spin till I fall down! We interrupt this ancient prophecy to bring you a late-breaking bulletin. Great Wall of Prophecy! Reveal to us God's will that we may blindly obey! Free us from thought and responsibility! We shall read things off you! Then do them! Your words guide us! We're dumb! You know what else stinks about being a slave? The hours.",
"The prophecy is strange and crudely drawn at best. It indicates that we are here… and our next Pharaoh is over there, near some tents. Those are waves, jackass! It's supposed to be a river! I know who the next Pharaoh is! Oh, lord. We hear your voice, great Pharaoh! Reveal yourself to us! Behold! I have emerged from the place of spells and fairies! It is he, just as the Wall of Prophecy prophesied! Long live Pharaoh Bender! Long live Pharaoh Bender! This society is a bunch of idiots.",

And now the unveiling! Remember me! Remember me! Remember me! Does it please you, my lord? It's a good start. Yeah, it's definitely big. I just wonder if it's too big, you know? Are people gonna be remembering me or the statue? We made it to your exact specifications. Tear it down and try again! But this time, don't embarrass yourselves! Ladies and gentlemen, the Pharaoh suddenly died.",
"Good riddance. What about my servants? Bender, I really hope that's you, because if it isn't… we're in trouble. You jerk! Why'd you have to drag us along? I wanted to watch you remember me. You thought you'd need this junk in the afterlife? Afterlife? If I had to go through another life, Rot in peace. Fry and I are leaving. Sorry, but we're totally sealed in. Nothing can get in or out except millions of snakes. Have a pomegranate schnapps from my distillery… and start sharing fond memories of me, Bender.",
"What proof is this? Some huge number? We could ignite the distillery and blow this place to rubble! Let's get a little kindling going. You can't blow up my monument! I won't be remembered! Oh, right. How selfish of me. We'll just stay here forever. Hey, Fry? Remember that robot, Bender? Bender? Doesn't ring a bell. Did you hear something? I bet it wasn't someone good at stealing. Stop it! It's not right! You've crossed a line! You know who I remember? That guy who used to bend things. Hermes! All right, all right! If it means that much to you, Oh, Bender! When did you come in? Pharaoh Bender! He once more walks among the living! How we doing? Remember me! Please just leave me alone.",
"I understand your desire to be remembered… but you don't need a statue for that. I don't? You have your legacy as a brutal, tyrannical dictator… and that will outlive any monument.

Electronically transfer your space doubloons… afore I send thee to Davey Jarg's locker! Hey! Keep it down, you kids! I'm trying to take a nap! Come on.",
"Come on. Make Bender take a nap in a tube. Come back when I've had Fry to battle stations. Fire torpedo three. Firing torpedo number three. That's not torpedo three! Damn you, Fry and Lee. la! Too late I realize that me children are me only real treasures. Help! Mechanical man overboard! Go after him, Leela. We were going full speed when we fired him… so he's going faster than that. We can't catch him even if we rub the engine with cheetah blood? I don't know how to say this.",
"Bender is doomed to drift through space. Forever. He always wanted to drift forever… but through the American Southwest. I'm going too fast. I've gotta lose momentum. I'm gonna spend eternity alone with barely any swag. Hey universe, check out the dude Wow, ostentatious. Except what good is a candelabra without. ? Wait, I know.

It means He who really loves the Metal Lord. Listen here, time for a religious donation. Hand over your wallet! But we are a poor and simple folk. Poor? Oh, crap! Pity me not, for I am richened What art thou doing, Malachi Jr. ? I'm practicing to hug Daddy. Gag unto me with a spoon. It's time I laid down a few commandments.",
"Take this down. Number one. Behold, the one commandmentCan you find him, professor? The Smell-a-Scope isn't strong enough. Bender's odor is so mild, it's being overpowered by local sources. Hooray! People are paying attention to me. Fry, we brought someone to cheer you up. His name is Helper. He is eager to be your new best friend. Hello, chum. Miss your buddy? Have a pudding pop. Want to go to an amusement park? Have fun. Hey, I heard Bender's back. enjoy that for a moment.",
"Microbrewed. My guys did all right. I think I'll make my countenance to shine down upon them. Good work. There's no slowing down with the Metal Lord tonight. Yes, tonight is kind of special. Did you rip off your arm as a joke? Nay. Like most of your followers, I was maimed building the great brewery. Others died from the fumes it spewed forth. And, of course, the liquor industry attracted organized crime. the Lord is moved by their plight. Malachi Jr. ! No! Daddy, I can't hold much longer.",
"My arms are tired from hugging. Save him. Save my son, Metal Lord. This looks like a job for God. What the. ? Malachi, what manner of deal is this with the chanting? They saw you save my son. Now everyone prays for their own miracles. Very well. What do they want? pray for wealth. That was a practice miracle. Who's next? They pray for sunlight… so their barley might make a more refreshing beer. Very well. Let there be light. Hooray! When you're writing the Bible, you might want to omit that last miracle.",
"He decided not to let go. I can't believe you're gone. I won't! If I can't reach you physically, I'll try something crazy. That's my story, Father Changstein el Gamahl. Can religion help me find my friend? We could join together in prayer. But is there anything useful we can do? Sure, I hold séance, channel your friend. No problem. Insert coin. I am your friend, Bonder. Bonder? Is it really you? Yes. I am fine. Give the gypsy $10. Wait, Bender's name isn't Bonder, it's Bender. You're a fraud.",
"You want false hope or not? Only if there's no real hope. There is perhaps one way. Have you heard of the Monks of the Shubah? I've not heard of them. They are an ancient order. in the depths of space. a powerful radio telescope… high in the Himalayas to search for him. They'd let me use it to find Bender? I mean, yes. I'm sure they will. Yes. Oh, Metal Lord, hear my prayer! The infidels on your back no longer believe in you. They say their prayers go unheeded. How am I supposed to hear prayers coming out of my ass? They talk of war against the faithful.",
"I beseech thee, rise up against them. Smite someone who deserves it for once. Every time I interfere, I only make things worse. It's best to solve your own problems. But Metal Lord. What part of nay doesn't thou understand? I'm outfitting an expedition to the Himalayas. I'll need a coat. I miss Bender almost half as much You can't give up hope just You gotta hope even more and cover your ears and goAt once, sir! Well, you won't listen to reason… so I'll listen to idiotic-ness and come too.",
"But we'll need a Sherpa to guide us. Now that's one Bible that doesn't disappoint. Looks like society's running pretty well without my meddling in. Atomic bombs? Those unbelievers from my backside found my nuclear pile. Fear not, Lord. We shall be with you soon. of being with me! We will solve our own problems. It is time to convert the unbelievers. Convert them? To radioactive vapor! Look, Daddy, I'm hugging God. Maybe if I hug him real hard, he'll save us from. Hello? Is anyone still alive? How about in the porno theater? Don't be embarrassed.",
"They're dead. All dead. Who would have known playing God could have such terrible consequences? If I die of exhaustion, make sure my body freezes in a dignified position. None of that huddled for warmthcrap. Behold! The monastery of the Shubah. I am not holy enough to enter. Looks rickety. We'd better test it. Welcome to our monastery. Please stand to one side to let faster pilgrims by. Hey! That galaxy's signaling in binary. I've gotta signal back! But I only know enough binary to ask for the bathroom.",
"Speak English? I do now. What are you, a galactic computer? Possible. I am user-friendly, I have always been. Oh, my God! Are you God? Possible. I do feel compassion for all living things, my good chum. But why would God think in binary? Unless you're not God… but the remains of a computerized space probe that collided with God! That seems probable. A member of our brotherhood sits at the controls constantly… scanning the heavens for God. There he is! No. No, wait.",
"How long have you been at it? 700 years. We've not yet examined one ten-millionth of the sky. We will find the Almighty, even if it takes to the end of time. And then what? Then we utter unto him a short prayer. an amplifying transmitter. Like a giant karaoke machine? Not really. Want to see our giant karaoke machine? Not really. Finding God, that's important… but it might be a treat if you let me use the telescope to find my friend. I don't know what to say, other than absolutely not! Your loss is tragic, but our work.",
"You can look for God forever. I'm just asking for one lifetime to find my friend! He speaks out of love for his friend. Perhaps that love is God. How convenient. A theory about God that doesn't require a telescope. Get back to work! That telescope is as much mine as anybody's! I'll use it with or without permission! Your order may be famous for martial arts, but I can clobber any holy man. Actually, we only practice martial arts as meditation. We are strictly nonviolent. Then get in the laundry room, or I'll kick your butts! Oh, this is the worst crazy sect I've ever been in.",
"Do you know what I'll do before I do it? What if I do something different? Then I don't know that. A lot of people pray to you, huh? Yes, but so many ask so much… after a while, you just tune it out. You know, I was God once. Yes, I saw. You were doing well until everyone died. It was awful. I tried helping them. I tried not helping them. In the end, I couldn't do any good. Do you think what I did was wrong? Right and wrong are words. What matters is what you do. Yeah, I know.",
"That's why I asked if what I did. Oh, forget it. Bender, being God isn't easy. Do too much, people get dependent. If you do nothing, they lose hope. like a safecracker or a pickpocket. Or a guy who burns a bar for insurance money! an electrical thing. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. Does that mean you wouldn't send me to Earth, even if I prayed? Earth? Which way is that? I don't know. Bender? Bender? Let us out! We cooked our shoes in the dryer and ate them.",
"Now we're bored! Has anyone out there seen Bender? No! Quit asking! It's been three days. Even if you stay the rest of your life… there is virtually no chance of finding him. It's time to give up. You're right. I'm never gonna see him again. I know he was evil, and on more than one occasion. But still, I wish I had Bender back. I wish I had Bender back! What? You say something? Well, so long. Remember what we talked about. Bender! It's a miracle! This is, by a wide margin, the least likely thing ever to happen.",
"You'll never believe what happened! First, I was God. Then I met God! We locked up some monks! Oh, no! We forgot to let them out of the laundry room! Do we have to? They're monks. Their God will let them out… or give them more shoes to eat. Fat chance! You can't count on God for jack! He pretty much told me so! Now come on! If we don't save those monks, no one will! When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. 1 Future Shock Good thing I noticed that.",

You look really cute in your uniform. I thought I was doing something heroic! You are! What about that little girl you visited in the hospital who died? You're right. I can't let people down anymore. God's my witness, I vow to earn the respect of girls and women everywhere! blernsball player of all time! That's statistically impossible.",
"In 77 innings, you haven't gotten one out. At this rate, you'll be the worst player of all time. Then I have a new vow. I solemnly swear… I will become not the worst blernsball player of all time! Look! The players who broke the various color barriers! When will man learn that all races are equally inferior to robots? If I could be just a little better than him, I can hold my head high. He once struck out when his tongue He tried to catch with an oven mitt! It's a crummy hologram.",
"I'm not a hologram. Hank Aaron the 24th. The original Hank Aaron was great! I was better than great. I was the home run king. So, Hank, the bad Hank, just how bad were you? My batting average was low. Low? It was zero! You went your whole career without getting a hit. without ever getting an out! You stink! Junior, she belongs in the exhibit instead of you! Forget it! Wade Boggs, goes down smooth. I don't want to be in this exhibit. I need your help, so I can be one tiny iota less pathetic than you.",
"I can't help you play better than Tiny lota. He was great! But I'll teach you all I know. Okay, let's see what you can do. She can lodge a ball in your brain. You better get a batting helmet. All right, low and away. Okay, try it again. But this time, keep your eye off the ball. You mean on the ball? Who's in the hall of fame? You're holding the bat upside down. Strike! Man, you did it, Leela! I didn't hit the batter! I was pitching and not just belly-itching! I think there's a rash going around.",
"Welcome to Fenway where the Mets end a season that ranks among the worst. You opened a franchise! Yes. Our biggest seller is Leela's Bean Pizza! Six kinds of beans plus things that look like beans. Beans, huh? This is great! How do you make the crust so fizzy? Ancient Signoid secret. My husband, some hotshot. Here's his ancient Signoid secret. Live hornets. We smoosh them right into dough. I don't care if it's horse manure. I want to buy this franchise. No! We come to Earth to make pizza, not money! No, Blek! Other way around.",
"Right. Offer accepted! Fans, Boston's turning the last game into a real squeeeker And that's with three E's! Two men on, and they're down to their last out. It's my last chance to prove I'm not the worst player ever. Put me in. No! We're actually winning this game! You only go in as a joke when we're eight runs behind! Come on! Let's see some fundamentals out there! And not clown fundamentals! Darn! Darn! Darn! Now the bases are loaded! Isn't there a man who can get one more out?! I can! I repeat.",
"Isn't there a man on. I've been training with Hank Aaron! The Hank Aaron? I've trained with a Hank Aaron. All right then… get in there and pitch like you've never pitched like you before! Now pitching for the Mets, Turanga Leela! Bean! Bean! Bean! Put it down the pike! Strike him out! Do it for the hundreds of women everywhere! Your attention! Now pinch-hitting for the Poindexters, Jackie Anderson! Look! College blernsball's finest female hitter… making her debut against the worst female anything.",
"I've never seen anything this weird and I've seen Mr. Belvedere naked! She's like any other player. She puts on her sports bra one arm at a time. Strike one! Strike one! A personal best! Strike two! This moment is brought to you by Month Old Franks… the hot dogs with experience! A grand slam blern! The Mets lose! Their season is over! Leela, the first woman ever to reach the majors… will go down as the worst player in the history of blernsball. She's taught the world that being a bum knows no gender.",
"Tonight we've seen the start of a great career… for the first woman to play the sport well, Jackie Anderson! Jackie. I guess you were right… I'm a lousy role model. I'm sorry. No, don't be. You were an inspiration after all. You were so awful that women set out to prove they don't stink as bad as you. That's so kind of you. I guess I made a difference after all… please retire. Immediately. You're still the worst football player of all time. Welcome back.",
"Our next guest has taught the world to cook for over 20 years. But apparently my wife hasn't been listening. Funny. I will destroy her! And now, extend a formulaic greeting to master chef Elzar. So, what will you be cooking for Morbo to devour with his mighty jaws? I'm gonna whip you up a nice, unnameable horror from beyond… with mango chutney. Pathetic humans, prepare to write down the recipe! What's with the pots and pans? Building a wife? Part of one. Meantime, I'm cooking up a tasty Sunday brunch for my friends.",
"Brunch. Right. I'd better warn. Tell. Warn-tell the others. Yes. It's a perfect scale model of the universe's largest bottle. I put a tiny spaceship inside to keep it from being boring. Get! For the last time, Zoidberg, look with your eyes, not your claws! Brace yourselves. Bender is making us brunch. Oh, God, my tract! He's proud of his cooking. If we don't eat, he'll be crushed. Don't panic. If we can get to the ship, we'll fly north… and hide under the polar icecaps.",
"Fleeing somewhere? With you blocking the only escape route? Don't be silly. In that case, brunch is served. Let's go, move it out! Stop crying, Leela. Zoidberg, are you coming? Sure. Me. I don't want you touching that thing! I know that. Surrender your mysteries to Zoidberg. Oh, no, professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg fixes it, then perhaps gifts. I've personalized each of your meals. For example, Amy, you're cute, so I baked you a pony. Come on, eat! I slaved all day over a filthy stove.",
"This is terrible! Good thing I secretly installed this wormhole in the table. Where does the other end come out? You know, I'm not quite sure. Dear me. The pie is ready. You guys like swarms of things, right? Casual hello. It's me, Zoidberg. Act naturally. How interesting, Dr. Zoidberg. Do go on. Check out the palm tree. It gets sick when I cook brunch. How's that for coincidence, professor, with all your precious science? I don't want to hurt his feelings, but this tastes better as vomit.",
"It's unbearable. What would it cost to get my tongue removed? And this time I mean it! Who am I kidding? It was stupid of me to dream of becoming a chef. I don't have what it takes, and nothing can change that. Then it's settled. Elzar will teach me to cook! Absolutely not. But I watch your show. You owe me. I owe you nothing! One, your antenna's in my crotch. And finally, you can't cook for squat. What was the first one? I thought that was number two. I knocked it up a notch. Bam! I'll never recombobulate this ship.",
"When the professor finds out, he'll tear me a new cloaca! Wait. What would the robot do? Frame someone. It's over. My dream of being a chef is deader than the cat I'm sitting on. Gus, let's give a friendly welcome to this new robo. A robo You know, a robot hobo. Okay. I thought you said romo No offense intended, my filthy friend. In fact, why not join us and ride the space rails? Get ready. We's gonna jump off at that switching prism. We're going nearly the speed of light, so roll when you land.",
"Biggest hobo jungle in the quadrant. I've seen bigger. Wait, I'm thinking of Eugene, Oregon. Wait, a pie with hobo-lifting aroma? Helmut Spargle. He used to be the greatest chef. His restaurant was so high-toned, to get reservations… you had to create a parallel universe, where you had reservations! I once ate there, back when I was a senator. Yo, Spargle, if you're such a great cook, how'd you end up in this dump? Down-Home Country Kitchen mit Helmut Spargle. One day, the Extreme Soda Company that sponsored the show.",
"Decided it was too old-fashioned. Spargle, you're fired. We need a chef who attracts a younger, more extreme cooking-show viewer. Elzar! Get lost, old man. Mein soufflé! Elzar had been seduced by the dark side of cooking. Cilantro, mango salsa, raspberry vinaigrette. That twizzler. As for me, I went temporarily insane and wound up here… making pies out of shoes. My story's like yours, only interesting. It involves robots. That jerk, Elzar, ruined my dream of being a chef too.",
"Interesting. You wish to cook, but as a robot, you have no sense of taste. It's so unfair. I have eight other senses… but I'd trade them all, even smision, to be able to taste! Without the distraction of taste… your mind is free to touch the Zen of pure flavor. You could be the greatest chef! Just as Beethoven was a great composer Or how Rembrandt was blind and had wooden hands! Bender, hear me well. I shall train you. First, forget everything you know of cooking. Done.",
"That's right, Ricardo. A ship in a bottle. Well, hang on, I'll look. I've gathered you in the accusing parlor… because one of you is a miniature-ship wrecker. I'm acting astonished. Certain clues suggest the culprit is none other than our own Philip J. Fry. It was a brilliant scheme… but you made one fatal mistakeleaving this confession note! Scoundrel. I don't remember any of that… but I can't defend myself. I have no choice but to charge you the full cost of the materials.",
"$10. There you go. What have I done? Your training is complete, little dessert spoon. Just as he who wishes to be world chess champion must win at least… one game of chess, so must you serve at least one edible meal. Succeed and I shall reveal to you… the age-old secret of perfect flavor. Slop's on. Fine-looking eats. All right! Another thing I'm great at! Wait, why'd you stop eating, master? What? My dinner killed you? Man! It hurts. Stay confident. The important thing is, you defeat Elzar after I am gone.",
"And using this, you cannot fail. A diamond vial of Mrs. Dash? No, it is the essence of pure flavor. A few drops will cause the inner perfection of any dish to blossom forth. There goes my. I'll avenge you, master! I swear, in the presence of these drunken bums… that I shall defeat Elzar! I'm not drunk. I'm mentally ill. Elzar, I'm a walking pile of your unfinished business! Helmut Spargle has a message for you! Spargle? What'd he do, bland himself to death? No, he was eating some food I made and by coincidence, his stomach exploded.",
"Now I'm here to avenge him! Seems you're the one who killed him. Maybe so, but you're his sworn enemy! I challenge you to a battle Scandalous! We'll meet on the ancient televised battleground of Kitchen Coliseum. Whosever meal is best will claim the title of Iron Cook. Iron Cook? I can't lose. I'm 30 % iron. You're going down! Also, I had a reservation for one, under Dr. Bender. Please welcome the superintendent of Kitchen Coliseum, Chairman Koji! No robot chef has competed here. But today, one has barged his way in to challenge for the title ofIron Cook! Meet our celebrity judges.",
"Globetrotter Ethan BubblegumTate. Konnichiwa, brother. TV anchor-monster Morbo. Greetings, pathetic host. A woman who ended a galactic war with apple dandies… Martha Stewart's head. The secret is fresh pork. Now Koji will present the theme ingredient to be used in every dish. If it's chicken, chicken ŕ la king. Fish, fish ŕ la king. Turkey, fish ŕ la king. Soylent Green! Soylent Green, a classic ingredient of gourmet cooking. And the battle is on. What's Elzar making? Well, Hiroki-san, when I asked him.",
"He asked what it was to me and conjectured my mother was a prostitute. In the countryside, prostitutes decorate rooms with festive gourds. Thirty minutes to go. Look at him roll dough! I've never seen such powerful strokes of the ass. You've never seen mine. No, I haven't. Fifteen minutes remaining. The Iron Cook is bringing in his signature creation… a working pastry replica of downtown Venice. Commemorative turkey basters. Get your commemorative basters. Yo, hook me up.",
"My turkey is dry, and I've tried everything. Right. Never mind. The guilt. The unbearable guilt! Fifteen seconds. Ten seconds. Master Spargle, if you can hear me up in that ditch, where I left you… this is for you. The Iron Cook's gone all out for the judges. He's even garnished the salad with $100 bills. Let's see what they think. Soylent Green is my kind of people. Scrumptious. Morbo will store this in his sack for future digestion. I'm swimming in my Soylent waste.",
"It's a good thing. Next up, Bender, a student of legendary Helmut Spargle… Bender is some sort of wonderful mechanical man. This food looks kind of funky, but it tastes kind of funk-ay! The challenger's ugly food shows even hideous things… can be sweet on the inside. Now judgment. The winner will be the new Iron Cook. The loser is doomed to scrub. Whose confection achieves perfection? Challenger Bender! That's my robot! I own him! You honor me, Chairman Koji. Domo arigato, Mr.",
"Roboto. Chairman-san, I came here with one goalTo humiliate Elzar in a large stadium. I believe I've done that. No question. But the true Zen of flavor is not found in a coliseum. It is found in a small kitchen with friends. So I decline the title of Iron Cook… and accept only the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Also, it comes with double prize money. Wait. Everyone must know. I broke the professor's bottled ship! And what is worse, I framed my dearest friend, Fry! I can never repay him his $10, so I must take the only honorable path.",
"Here I go already! That sword cost $5000! Fry did it. And that's how I defeated Elzar, thanks to Spargle's magic liquid. Yes, we were there, and we just watched it again on TV. Let me see that vial, Bender. Good Lord! According to the spectrolizer… Spargle's magic ingredient was water! Ordinary water. So the real gift Spargle gave you was the confidence to be your best. Yes, ordinary water, laced with nothing more than a few spoonfuls of LSD.",
"The important thing is, by my standards, I won fair and square. Now, who wants brunch cooked with plenty of confidence? I'm in! Crimes of the Hot Hurry up with the water. I'm steaming inside my own shell, I am. Man, it's hot. How hot is it? It's so hot, I poured McDonald's coffee in my lap to cool off. Johnny Carson said it. No, Nibbler! Don't drink the pool water! It's full of chlorine. Oh, wait, chlorine. Perhaps this movie will help take our minds off the heat. Global Warming orNone Like It Hot! You're probably wondering why your ice cream went away.",
"Well, Suzie, the culprit isn't foreigners. It's global warming. Meet Mr. Sunbeam. He comes all the way from the sun to visit Earth. Hello, Earth. Just popping in to brighten your day. And now I'll be on my way. Not so fast, sunbeam. We're greenhouse gases. You ain't going nowhere. Oh, God, it hurts! Pretty soon, Earth is chock-full of sunbeams… their rotting corpses heating our atmosphere. How do we get rid of the greenhouse gases? Fortunately, our handsomest politicians came up with a cheap.",
"Iast-minute way to combat global warming. Ever since 2063, we simply drop a giant ice cube… into the ocean every now and then. in his drink every morning. And then he gets mad. Of course, since the greenhouse gases are still building up… it takes more and more ice Thus, solving the problem once and for all. Once and for all! Well, we just need one Call the losers who were supposed to deliver it. President Nixon here. I'm hiring you losers to deliver the ice.",
"And hurry up. I'm sweating like J. Edgar Hoover trying to squeeze into a new girdle. You heard the good news, everyone. Save the Earth, et cetera, et cetera. Bye. Wait. Where do we get the ice? Oh, Halley's comet, of course. The only sufficient source of ice cubes that don't have bugs in them. Wow. Mining a comet. That sounds fun. Yes. There's no safer occupation than mining. Especially when you're perched on a snowball… whipping through space at a million miles an hour.",
"Deploying ice drill. Wow. That ice dispenser's so big the ice crushes you. Yakov Smirnoff said it. No, he didn't. Activating ice drill. Like some outer-space Motel 6. This could mean the end of the banana daiquiri as we know it. Earth is experiencing the devastating effects of intense global warming. Morbo is pleased but sticky. The scorching heat has melted the polar icecaps… causing floods of biblical proportion. They called me crazy for building this ark. You are crazy.",
"You filled it with same-sex animal couples. Hey! There are parts of the Bible I like and parts I don't like. Direct your pity now to the African turtles… seen here migrating to cooler homes in Holland. That poor turtle. Bender, are you crying? No. Never. Morbo wishes these stalwart nomads peace amongst the Dutch tulips. I'm sure those windmills Windmills do not work that way! Good night! Well, everybody, I just saved a turtle. What have you done with your lives? You went all the way to Holland already? Bender, a turtle isn't yourself.",
"Why do you care about it? Because I also care deeply about things that remind me of myself. Like poor little Shelly here. What could you possibly have in common with this walking soup mix? For one thing, we both have a tough outer shell. But lead a rich, inner life. And also… well, you know. You're both alcoholic, whore-mongering, chain-smoking gamblers? Neither of us can get up when we get knocked on our back. What? I've seen you get up off your back tons of times.",
"Those times I was slightly on my side. Interesting. Maybe we should test this erectile dysfunction of yours, Bender. No, that's not necessary, really. I think I hear my factory recalling me. That's what I get for sharing my vulnerability with you. Calling all scientists. There will be a worldwide conference on global warming in Kyoto, Japan. I've got a degree in homeopathic medicine. You've got a degree in baloney. Professor Farnsworth, you're a scientist. Forget it. I'm not going.",
"I have my reasons. Strange. You haven't acted this suspicious since I found the ape bonesin the basement. My hip hurts. I'm in the middle of cooking a turkey. I have warranty cards to fill out. I am not just making excuses. All right, I'll go! I can't believe it! It's Professor Hubert Farnsworth! He's looking sharp in a standard white lab coat and dark slacks. His wristwatch is a Casio. Thank you all for coming. It is my pleasure to introduce the host of the Kyoto Global Warming Convention.",
"The inventor of the environment and first emperor of the moon, AI Gore. I have ridden the mighty moon worm. Good for him. My fellow Earthicans, as I discuss in my book, Earth in the Balance… and the much more popular Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth… we need to defend our planet against pollution, as well as dark wizards. Sure, blame the wizards. That's why I'm offering a bag of moon sapphires… to the first scientist who can solve this problem once and for all.",
"Lovely, aren't they? Sapphires? With those, I could open the gate of Girash. First up is Professor Ogden Wornstrum. Wornstrum! Ladies and gentlemen, I have placed in orbit a giant mirror… that will reflect 40 percent of the sun's rays, thus cooling Earth. Observe. Problem solved. That's a little bright. All right. What else we got? Professor, you're a professor. Absolutely not! I won't speak. I've got nothing to hide. Our next speaker is Professor… I demand the floor! Yes, it's your turn to speak.",
"Well, nuts to me. I'm taking the stage. I know the source of the greenhouse gases… but in my shame, I've kept it secret for 75 long years. Oh, it haunts my memory still. Professor, no! Don't do it! Don't do what? Don't use this memory ray so I can remember what happened back then? It was October 1 7 at 1 :54 p. m. and 1 4 birds were flying by the window. I was working at Mom's Friendly Robot Company. Back then, robots were slow-moving, stiff and a little on the uptight side.",
"Oh, dear, might I favor master with a tender kiss on the forehead? Oh, I've failed again. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. The company's owner pressured me to create a sportier robot. It wasn't easy. But by sacrificing fuel efficiency, I succeeded. A flaming burp. It's not always a burp. We still have one problem, though. This robot would never meet emission standards. Crap spackle! We'll just call it a sport utility robot and classify it as a light truck. I suppose the environment can take one more for the team.",
"If only I had made the effort to develop a cleaner-burning robot… but I was tired and in love. Take me now, you stud. That's awful, professor. Especially the making-out part. Yeah, I didn't need to hear that. All modern robots descend from my original smog-blasting designs… and that's the cause of global warming today. So the robots are to blame, We are left with only one possible course of action, grim though it be. I got a good feeling about this. We must immediately and permanently.",
"Shut down, dismantle and destroy all robots! Wait! Surely there's a better- The conference is over. I must go now to help collect cans on Jupiter. Destroy all robots! Destroy all robots! Poor Bender. Be brave, my friend. Come on. You've got to come out of your chest sometime. Would you do it for a Bender snack? I don't even want the stupid beer. Yes! You tried to trick me into coming out of my chest. But who has the beer now? It's a party, apparently. Do you like to party? To boogie down? Well, I'm throwing an all-night beach rager for my robot pals.",
"It all goes down this Saturday on the isolated Galápagos lslands… where there will be no escape… from the fun. All robots must attend! Strange. Why would Nixon, an awkward, uncomfortable man, throw a party? One of the most social events imaginable? It's a trap is why! They're going to deactivate all the robots. I don't hear any gasping. We all figured that out. We can hide you. We'll pile fruit on you and claim you're a bowl. No. I'm going to the party.",
"I won't let you! Fry, as you know, there are lots of things I'm willing to kill for. Jewels, vengeance, Father O'Malley's weed whacker. But at long last, I've found something I'm willing to die for. This mindless turtle. Bender, this world isn't good enough for you. Not even close. Goodbye, everybody. Don't touch my stuff after I'm dead. It's booby-trapped! Come on. Come on, baby. Poor guy. Maybe you'd feel better if I had a drink. Crummy keg, it's completely tapped- Oh, you're a robot.",
"Don't stop. Attention, happening robots. to party with Nixon? You fellas enjoy yourselves for the next two hours… and be sure not to leave the island for at least two hours. I'm going out Two hours. Okay, headless body of Agnew, let's blow this joint. BIG Do you want to dance? No, I'm not really in the- You know you want to. Per your orders, I modified my mirror… to fire a colossal electromagnetic Every robot will be instantly and painfully terminated.",
"Now, for your part of the bargain. Very well. Agnew, you belong to Wornstrum now. I'll say goodbye now. There ain't no turtles where Daddy's going. Don't tell anybody, but Nixon's about to shut all the robots off and- We're gonna die! We're going to the great beyond. Nixon's not bringing the smokes. Shut up and pay attention to me. Bender. Look, I love life and its pleasures as much as anyone here. Except perhaps you, Hedonism Bot. But we need to be shut off! Especially you, Hedonism Bot.",
"I apologize for nothing. We're destroying the world and killing the turtles! To hell with the turtles! No one insults the turtles! Come on, you! Let the games begin. Everyone listen! Ah! Damn! I've devised a way to save you and stop global warming at the same time. Granted, you're all blasting out greenhouse gases. You're one to talk. But we can use those very gases to save the planet. If you all vent your exhausts directly upward in one burst… it should thrust the Earth further from the sun, thus cooling it.",
"By my calculations, we'll need the full force of every last robot. So quickly, everyone point your exhaust vents straight upward. Now vent. Vent like the wind! Harder! Harder! Why isn't this working? Some lazy or polite robot is holding it in. A billion robot lives are about to be extinguished. Oh, the Jedis are going to feel this one. I'm sorry, buddy. on our backs, helpless. What the hell are you doing? Hey, are you trying Ah-ha! I'm even greater than I thought I was. And now to fulfill my destiny! Fire! Professor, for saving the Earth and foiling me.",
"I proudly, yet angrily, present you with Earth's new highest honorThe Polluting Medal of Pollution. Thank you. I deserve this. Hey, professor? Now that the Earth's orbit… is further from the sun, won't that make the year longer? One week longer to be exact. In that case, I hereby declare it Robot Party Week! All right, baby! Jurassic Bark For my next trick, notice I have nothing up my sleeves… and nothing in my head. So if my lovely assistant will kindly supply me.",
"Behold! The milk has vanished! Exiled, perhaps, to another dimension! Amazing! That's why they call you Bender the Magnificent. No, it isn't. They discovered an intact 20th-century pizzeria, like the one I used to work at! Interesting. No, wait, the other thing. Let's check it out. You can see how I lived before I met you. You lived before you met me? Sure. Lots of people did. Truly, they were as gods Next, we come to the splendidly preserved wooden pizza paddle.",
"Scientists theorize it was used to gently discipline the delivery boy. Wait a second. This is Panucci's! I used to work in this exact pizzeria. And for your information, lady, this was not just used to paddle my butt. and crush rats. I don't know where you get your facts, sir… but I am a volunteer housewife with 45 minutes of orientation… and a Harlequin romance about archeologists. Don't wave your fancy degrees at me. I recognize all this stuff. Petrified sausages, old Mr.",
"Vitelli, and that's- Pizza delivery for Mr. Seymour Asses? There's no one by that name here or anywhere. I hope that in time you'll realize what an idiot you've been. I wouldn't count on that. Poor little guy. You look like you haven't eaten in a month. Here. But if Mr. Panucci asks, your name is Seymour Asses. I like you, Seymour. You're not constantly judging me, like all the other dogs. Are you? We understand each other.",
"But you're keeping it real and you call no man Mister. Live long and prosper. That's the least appetizing calzone I've ever seen. No! That's my dog in there! It's an outrage, I say. I'm taking him home and I'd like to see anyone try and stop me. And then he was ejected by the guards. Needless to say, I was mortified. Well, it's not right to make my dead pet an exhibit. That's like digging up Lassie and putting her in the Louvre. Lassie is on display in the Louvre. I know. I was deliberately describing a similar situation.",
"Why don't you try protesting, like those native Martians. Always whining that people don't treat their ancestors' bones with respect. Protesting never works. You're right. I'll give it a shot! What do you want? Fry's dog! When do you want it? Fry's dog! I will now perform my people's native dance. It says here that this part. implores the gods to grant a favor, usually a Trans Am. Thattaboy, Seymour. Right here waiting for me as always. Just like that huge mushroom in my shower.",
"Hey, there's our little mascot. You been swimming in the sewer again? You rascal. Fry, cleanup! Seymour, cleanup! That's a good Seymour. There's dog fur on my slice! No, that's vermicelli. No fur in here. He can do two things at one timeeat and swim. Three things! Fry, it's been three days. You can't keep boogying like this. You'll come down with a fever of some sort. I'm Dr. Ben Beeler, the paleontologist who discovered your dog. Or as some call it, the Beelersaurus. So do I get Seymour back? Are you caving to political pressure? No.",
"We're sorry, but there's just too much… that fossil can teach us about dogs from your time. His name was Seymour. He was once intimate with the leg of a wandering saxophonist. He had wet dog smell, even when dry. And he was not above chasing the number 29 bus. The 29? lnteresting. That's all I needed, right? Okay, then. Here's your dog back. Seymour! Lady and gentleman… how about a hand for my temporary replacement assistant? I was all in this part! It's magic! You're not fit to wear Fry's leotard! Good news, everyone! Hurray, he's back! And he's looking for a garbage can to put the rock in.",
"Here you go, buddy. No. Actually, we've discovered that Fry's dog was fast-fossilized… preserving its cellular structure. Which means we can clone it! Seymour will live again! A little land mammal. Can you believe it, Bender? I'm gonna have my best friend back! Why the idiot convention? Cubert, my precious babe. I'm going to attempt to clone Fry's dog… using the very same apparatus I used to clone you. Look! There's a smidge of toe still in here. You see, beneath the fossil's crunchy mineral shell.",
"There's still a creamy core of dog nougat. So will Seymour remember how to sing Walking on Sunshine? Amazingly, yes. In cases of rapid fossilization, I can press this brain scan button… retrieving Seymour's memories at the precise instant of doggy death. I'm gonna get my puppy back! ln your face, Grim Reaper! Crappy, ineffective reaper. I just need to reset the Clone-O-Mat from human mode to dog mode. You stink, loser! Hey, Fry, pizza going out. Come on! But I'm celebrating New Year's Eve.",
"Like you got squat to celebrate. You're a delivery boy this millennium… and you'll be a delivery boy next millennium. What's with Seymour? It's like he don't want you to go. Or he thinks your pants is too short. Which is crazy, because frankly, you look fabulous. Now get going! I won't be gone long, Seymour. Just wait here till I come back. Hello? Pizza delivery for… I. C. Wiener? Oh, crud. Here's to another lousy millennium.",
"A dog collar, for me? You shouldn't have. That's for Seymour. A subscription to the Daily Growl? That's not a reputable journal of opinion. That's for Seymour. I'm getting everything ready for when he's cloned. Are you on the junk, Fry? Why waste time on a creature of inferior intelligence? Hey, he was smart. He could fetch. I can fetch! He could dig up bones. Hello? Charlemagne? Plus, I bet he couldn't create a laser show with his head. Look, Bender, this has nothing to do with you.",
"I'm working on Seymour's doghouse. No one ever asked if Bender would like to live in a tiny little house. A tiny little house that says Benderon it. This is Fry. If you're calling about the used towels for sale… they're still available for $45 each. Phil, it's your father. Where are you? You're holding up New Year's brunch. Your brother can't wait any longer. Hello, first bologna of the new millennium. Here he comes. That's him and Seymour. Well, that's weird. Seymour's here, but- Go! Go! Touchdown! But where's Philip? I'm telling you, the Y2K computers got him.",
"We'll face burning roads, rivers exploding… calculators transformed into Scud missiles. There's nothing we can do. What's that, Seymour? You walking on sunshine? He's trying to tell us something. Maybe he can lead us to Philip! To our deaths? Negatory. It's the Y2K trying to lure us into an ambush. And I ain't buying it. Pass the bologna. Are you gonna be done soon? Sorry, but we need to practice hand-to-hand combat… in case an enemy knocks the laser guns out of our hands.",
"I'm setting up Seymour's dog bed. Oh, hello, Fry. I guess I didn't notice you there. I'm having such fun with my new best friend, Robo-Puppy. That's nice. I was just out walking him. Yes, you can walk him. Of course, after he goes, you have to refill the canisters. Come here, boy! Pet, pet, pet. Robo-Puppy receiving petting. Bender, are you jealous of Fry's puppy? That's so adorable! Jealous? Not when I have the love of Robo-Puppy here.",
"Robo-Puppy preparing to lick cheek. Robo-Puppy commencing cheek licking. Licking in progress. Licking complete. Robo-Puppy truly is robot's best friend. There. Perfect. Good news, everyone! The Clone-O-Mat is ready! Finally! Robo-Puppy commencing two-hour yipping session. Robo-Puppy mistreatment alert! Robo-Puppy mistreatment alert! Behold once more, the mighty Clone-O-Mat! Requiring such vast amounts of electricity… that we must harness the elemental power of nature itself! I speak, of course, of molten lava deep within the Earth's core.",
"To the subbasement! Powering up Clone-O-Mat! Placing fossil on the Plat-Clone-O-Form. Initiating dog brain CAT scan! Come on, boy. Come back to life. Know ye now what feels like Commencing DNA extraction. Fry, come on! The talent show. What? I'm in the middle of something. But if we don't perform, in what sense do we have an act? Bender, enough. Leave me alone! I thought you were my friend. But if you love your dog so much, maybe you'd rather play fetch! You evil, metal man! Ow! So anyway, your dog is melted.",
"Now we're friends again. Not necessarily. For the dog may yet survive. Indeed. You see, the tough, black mineral that won't cop out when there's heat all about. By contrast, observe the lava's affect on this ice swan. Of course, that would've melted even at room temperature. I just wanted to get rid of it. But had it been made of that righteous mineral dolomite… there's a slim chance it might have survived. So Seymour might still exist? Perhaps, for a few minutes.",
"Then I'm going in after him! He'd come after me! Acting like a moron won't bring your dog back. Then all hope is lost! Goodbye, Seymour. Please stop crying, Fry. Here. I assumed you were just pretending to toy with my emotions. What have I done? You didn't do anything. Don't beat yourself up. Fry, I'm sorry. I should have understood how someone can love an inferior creature. Not in the way of the ancient Greeks, but the way a robot loves a human… a human loves a dog, and occasionally, a gorilla loves a kitty.",
"I'm going in! I'm a professor! Why isn't anyone listening to me? You can't go in because you'll melt! The fossil only has a chance I'm 40 percent dolomite! Oh, it's hot. Oh, it's very hot! I am one hung-over cryogenicist. Throw that mutt in the freezer till his owners come. You can't solve all your problems by freezing them. I think you're forgetting our motto. Are you the cryogenicist who called about our son's dog? You must be the Frys. Yeah, he's right over there. Sorry we're late. We all got sick from eating bad bologna.",
"What's he so worked up about? because our boy's missing. Come on, you overgrown rat! Bender's been down there too long! I'm going in after him! Professor! Lava! Hot! I let my best friend risk his life Bender! And that is why they call me… Bender the Magnificent! Hey, where'd everybody go? Okay, let's clone us some dog. Very well. Let this abomination unto the Lord begin! Interesting. It seems Seymour died at the ripe old age of 1 5. Fifteen? You mean he lived for 1 2 more years after I got frozen? Indeed.",
"Stop the cloning. Oh, sure. Smash the smart guy's machine. Fry, what's wrong? Think about it. Seymour lived a full life after I was gone. He probably even added new songs to his repertoire. But that's a good thing. Walking on Sunshinesucks noodles. I had Seymour till he was 3. That's when I knew him and that's when I loved him. I'll never forget him. But he forgot me a long, long time ago. Ah, beer. So many choices. And it makes so little difference. How about Lobrau? It has dots on it.",
"Overruled! The choice of champions I can't drink that. The metal shavings make my throat bloody. Baby wants a Zima. Hey, hey. We can all fight when we're drunk. Listen, why don't we just brew our own beer? You can brew your own beer? Sure. The kids at the orphanarium Cursed bacteria of Liberia! My own son, suspended from boarding school. It's not my fault, Dad. And you, Cubert. I cloned you from one of my warts, and I can send you straight back there. What's going on? Is this angry yelling, or busted-hearing-aid yelling? I'm afraid it's both.",
"Now, hold on. Everyone cool your daiquiris. Let's give the little vermin a chance to explain themselves. It was self-defense, Mom. Just look at this letter the principal sent. We were in science class… and we had finished building a miniature black hole. Pretty scrawny black hole. It must be hungry. Black holes don't need food. Neither do nerds. My Manwich! That's it. You've compressed our lunches to a singularity… for the last time. Salt him, Dwight. When I re-solidify, I'm gonna put you in a world of goop.",
"See? That bully started it. We couldn't fight back with brawn… so we used our brains. I warned you not to use those things! Let's see. We've got our malt. Our hops. We just need a big disposable tub to mix it in. Now it needs to boil for a couple hours. Dwight, you remember the crew? Crew, you remember Cubert? Wonderful! Then I'm sure you won't mind… being their legal guardians for a month. Well, well, if it isn't my old friends, Stretch Pants, No Pants…",
"We're making beer. I'm the brewery. I heard alcohol makes you stupid. No, I'm. Doesn't. Actually, Dwight, you're right. Alcohol is very, very bad. For children. But once you turn 21… it becomes very, very good. So scram. Oh, man. Hey, Dad. What useless contraption are you half-baking today? Oh, this is my latest invention. A device that lets anyone sound exactly like me. Good news, everyone. I'm a horse's butt. I am? That's not good news at all, What's this device's marketability? Who's the target consumer? There is no target consumer.",
"Only targets. Targets that will tremble in fear as their new masters hand down edicts… in my glorious, booming voice! Now quit pestering me, you confounded scoundrels! Can I collate that? Can I shred these contracts? Wow! A power stamper. Now look at all the work I gotta do! The ingredients are cooked. They picked up some of your natural robot flavorings. Yeast? You mean I'll have a life form growing inside me? This is Professor Farnsworth. I have an important delivery for you and your dumb crew.",
"You must deliver a pizza a planet at the edge of the universe. Sorry I can't come to say goodbye, but I'm busy inventing useless junk. And I smell bad. If you were my kids, you'd get quite a talking to. From your father. When he got home from the Senate. Oh, bother. What have they done now? Those pork dumplings sent us on a fake pizza delivery. The address was on Dog Doo 8. But the universe ends right after Child-man, is this true? Yeah. But why are you mad at us? Your dummy brigade wasted a week on an obviously fake mission.",
"Plus, they're making bootleg beer inside company property. Lies! Lies and slander! Accusing gentle Bender of a misdeed? That's the last straw! You boys have been underfoot long enough. You jerked the words right out of my mouth. We're their fathers, and it's high times we acted like it. Here comes violence. I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. Come on, Dad. Shuffle faster! You don't wanna miss the unveiling of our company. Company? Cute. What'll you peddle? Lemonade? Shoeshines? Cootie insurance? Perhaps they've constructed a teddy bear hospital.",
"Actually, we're starting a competing delivery company. Welcome to the world of business. Who's going to use a delivery service with a kicked sign? We already have a client signed up. We're delivering the Daily Supernova. So your delivery company is just a cute, harmless paper route. No. It's a serious business. Yes. It's a tremendous responsibility, all right. What if a paper were to land in a puddle? Civilization as we know it treat us like dumb kids? We're practically old enough to find the Fox Network infantile.",
"All Awesome Express needs… is a sturdy interstellar delivery craft. You got a quarter? Man! The ad said to allow four to six seconds for delivery. More like seven. I'm really starting to swell up with beer. I must look ridiculous. Oh, my God! I just felt it ferment. Have you thought about a name? I was thinking Benderbrau if it's an ale… Botwiser if it's a lager. I hope it's a lager. I can take it to a ball game. I felt that one! There's a crack in the hull here.",
"Put a sticker on it. Off on your first delivery? You be careful, my little tinkler. Remember we used to call you that, huh? Tinkler. Gets moving. Those newspapers won't deliver themselves. Only the Sunday edition can do's that. Goodness, there must be 50 papers in that bundle. That's a big number, 50. Yeah. If you're an idiot. Three, two, one. See you at din-din. I'm blowing you a kiss. Take evasive action! It's closing in. You can't avoid it. It's a cheek-seeker.",
"Business is down, so I filed papers to have you all reclassified as slaves. Well, well, if it isn't our little munchkin moguls. What's the trouble, men? Need some penny rolls for your profits? Actually, thanks to Dwight's brilliant accounting… and my unaccountable brilliance… our paper route now has over a million customers! We're finally making more money than you guys. Aren't you impressed now, Pops? Aren't you? Aren't you? In a small way, yes. You still don't have your own building or conference table.",
"Our dads are never impressed, no matter what we do. Maybe we should start a fire. If we really want to impress them, we'll have to crush them with strategy. Dwight Lightning. Very well. But I get to name the next strategy. This week on The Real World The SunI'm burning to death! You know how much an apartment that big would cost on the sun? People! As you know, our young sons have become great successes… in the very same field as us. Oh, that's great! Naturally, we're humiliated.",
"That's why we need you, our loyal crew… to make Planet Express We'll start by slashing salaries. And this time, I mean really slashing. Guys? I don't know how so I'll just let Fry blurt it out thoughtlessly. We don't work for you anymore! Dwight and Cubert made us an offer. We're paperboys now. Incoming! We've got papers to stuff, team. Yes, sir. We're on it, Mr. Farnsworth. Folks? The situation is grim. But we shall prevail, thanks to you, our crack team of loyal dregs.",
"I don't even know who this guy is. I'm Scruffy, the janitor. Of course you are. Now, we've got to buckle down… and save Planet Express. I'm on break. Sorry to interrupt this whirlwind of activity, but we have an announcement. I direct your attention to the forms which I'm presently engaged in handing you. Sweet guinea pig of Winnipeg! They've taken over our company. Balderdash! I never agreed to that. No. But you did declare yourself dead three years ago as a tax dodge. Tax dodge, nothing! You take one nap in a ditch at the park.",
"They start declaring you this and that. Either way, I technically inherit your building and your spaceship. Which means Planet Express is now… Awesome Express. You rotten kids! Will you be hiring? You rotten kids! There. One million papers, folded and loaded. these flame decals I got in my cereal. They'll make the ship go faster. And what's your scientific basis for thinking that? Did I ever tell you how I used to own that ship? There but for the grace of God. Oh, my God! I think it's time! Hurry, Leela! Get some coasters and cold mugs.",
"Push, Bender! Push! You're doing great. Oh, it feels like it's trying to push a waterbed out of me. Almost there. Just two more bottles. Is it okay? I can't hear anything. It's an ale. Five gallons, six ounces. Hey, what's going on? This is a delivery company, not a delivery room. We busted our buns delivering a million papers… and this is how you greet us? With a bunch of frosty cold beers? Hey, wait a second. How did you deliver a million papers in one hour?'Cause we're awesome.",
"Hello, Awesome Express, the rude, crude delivery dudes. How may I direct your call? You haven't gotten your paper? In how long? Might a homeless old man have a touch more beef bourguignon… and another tequila slammer? Don't you sweet-talk me… you wrinkly old tube sock. May I have one too, wife? You're both pathetic, being jealous of your own offspring, instead of following in your food stamps. Oh, it's true. But they grow up so fast. We wanted a few more years of being better than them.",
"They're so stinking talented, they don't even need their fathers anymore. Dad! We screwed up. You did? Tough luck, suckers. Help us, Pops. We agreed to deliver way more papers than we could handle. We couldn't handle them. We dumped the extras in a crater on the moon. Now everybody's yelling at us about their missing papers. And we don't know what to do! We wanted you to be proud of us. Proud of you? You ruined us with sleazy business practices… and a complete disregard for human decency.",
"Of course we're proud of you. Damn right, we are! Now, come on, let's go do a little father-son weaseling out of this. Good thing I had this net installed for catching giraffes. how a paper man does it. Au revoir! Can I use the gun, Dad? What kind of father would I be if I said no? Only one house to go. Run away! That bully, Brett Blob, lives there. He's ugly, mean, stupid, stink mucus! And last week, we sort of broke his window. All right, all right. What do we do when we break somebody's window? Pay for it? Oh, heavens, no! We apologize with nice, cheap words.",
"I thought I heard the doorbell. But I see it was the dork bell. You made a funny good one, Brett. Now, now, no need to give us the business. We'd like a word with your daddy. Whatever. Dad! Don't worry, boys. I'm sure his father is a perfectly normal, reasonable man. What do you want? Mr. Blob, our sons have come to apologize for damaging your window. They've learned their lesson, and they want to make amends. Sorry, sir. Yeah, sorry. You shove your apology into the bottom of your one-way digestive system.",
"Now, see here. We assured our sons that you'd accept their apology. Tell you what. I'll accept their apology when they kiss my ass! Which I don't have. No one gives my boy that option. Bring it on, Jell-O pop. That was incredible! You are the bravest dads in the entire trauma center. until he digested you. Oh, you're good kids. If I could feel anything right now, it would be pride. I was wrong! I can still feel pain! He's come to finish the job. Someone toss me out the window! No, no wait.",
"I feel terrible about what happened. I've just been under a lot of stress lately down at the plant, you know? They're bringing in computers to improve productivity… and, well, that's no excuse for how I acted. But the boy needs to see that real men solve their disagreements with words… not violence… well, I hope we can put this embarrassing incident behind us. Hey, chumps. I heard you were on the ass end of an ass-kicking. I figured you could use a few of these.",
"Why not? Might as well live it up as long as I got this catheter in me. Won't you join us, Mr. Blob? Sounds like a plan. worth clinging to. Three fathers enjoying a day out with their sons. It would seem we've taught our boys a lesson about life. Man or blob, it's what's inside that counts. 1 A Taste of Freedom Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy! Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy! There's no denying it. The future's crazy. Oh, well, don't want to stand out. Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy! Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy! There's nothing crazy about it.",
"It's just Freedom Day! So, what is Freedom Day? Sounds like a feminine hygiene product. No, it's a fabulous, crab-ulous day! If you want to do something, you do it, and just spleck with the consequences. You know, like how I live every day. Happy Freedom Day! Oh, I think my wrist is broken. Of course, it wouldn't be Freedom Day without the traditional Freedom Tub! Mm. That'll feel nice on my shattered bones. Wow, nude hot-tubbing? That's all I need to hear about Freedom Day. Then consider the following lecture a bonus.",
"On Earth, freedom is a given. But on my planet, we have to suffer for it. Sure, you can be a comedian instead of a doctor… if you want your parents to roll over in their graves! Sure, you can vote for Skanadel, if you want there should be a recession! Sure, you can go to medical school… if you've given up on your dream of being a comedian! That's why I love Earth. You can do what you want, and no one makes you feel guilty… because no one cares. We're not listening! That's what I'm talking about! Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy! Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy! Excuse me, coming through.",
"Freedom train arriving on track one. Ooh, ooh! Ow! You broke my foot! Freedom. What's this next float, Linda? Representing our men, women and children in uniform… it's Earth's greatest space hero, Zapp Brannigan. Happy Freedom Day, ladies! Come on, let loose and show me something. Anything. Seriously, I'd take an armpit. Oh, yeah, thank you, Linda! You're welcome! Okay, Morbo, now it's your turn. If that is your Freedom Day wish… Thank you, secretary of transportation.",
"My fellow Earthicans, we enjoy so much freedom, it's almost sickening. We're free to choose which hand our sex-monitoring chip is implanted in. If we don't want to pay our taxes… why, we're free to spend a weekend with the Pain Monster. See you April 1 5, folks! Cue the fireworks guy! Incidentally, tonight's Freedom Day celebration is brought to you byShankman's Rubbing Compound. When something needs rubbing, think Shankman. Yay, Shankman! It costs more, but it's worth it.",
"Our planet has been through so much this past year. Wars, droughts, impeachments. But we've never lost our sense of what's truly importantThe great taste of Charleston Chew. And now, let us salute that beloved symbol of freedom… our flag, Ol' Freebie. I'm swelling with patriotic mucus. In our darkest hour, we can stand erect with proud, up-thrust bosoms. Anyone who laughs is a Communist. Knowing that, with a shifty glance skyward… we will see by the rocket's red glare, that our flag is still there.",
"It's gone! Yes, fellow patriots! I ate your flag! And I did it with pride. For to express oneself by doing a thing, is the very essence of Freedom Day! Bless this planet and all its wonderful people! Kill him! Kill the traitor! that desecrated our flag! Stop that red menace! My planet's embassy? They're paid to not kill me! I thought I understood this world. I thought I was fitting in. But I guess I don't belong here any more than I do on our crappy home planet. Sorry. What sorry? Our planet stinks.",
"We all know it. Enough with the persecution, I'm saying. Zoidberg, as ambassador, I promise you the full support of our government. Poor boy. You want maybe a nice mug cocoa? Ambassador Mervin, you and your staff are so kind. I'm truly humbled. What, no marshmallows? Well, let's storm the place! Without my prior knowledge. Coming through! Freedom Train! Step aside. You, too, fatso. Freedom! Cool your jowls, Nixon. You may not like it that Dr. Zoidberg desecrated a flag. You may even find the image of it festering in his bowels offensive.",
"But the right to freedom of expression is guaranteed by the Earth Constitution. Argh-ooh. Maybe so. But I know a place where the Constitution doesn't mean squat! The Supreme Court hereby accepts the case of Earth v. Zoidberg. Two, four, six, eight. Eating the flag is bad! Now, your noose knot has exactly seven twists. You can eat my dog You can eat my truck And you're out of luck She's waving proud around the world From Dallas to Fort Worth Let me say it again Don't mess with Earth They sure hate Dr.",
"Zoidberg. Posers! I was hating Zoidberg before it was cool. Where are we gonna find a lawyer to take his case? Once he's done singing. Don't mess with Earth Kill Zoidberg! Good night! Howdy, there. I'm a lawyer, and I'd like to help your friend out of this pickle. Who are you, old man? Name's Old Man Waterfall… but most folks just call me Old Man. I'll never remember that. I'm a veteran of three dozen wars. Name a body part and a planet, and I've taken a bullet in it, on it.",
"All to keep our flag flying free. And you want to defend Zoidberg? Are you familiar with the old robot saying, Does not compute? Son, to me a robot's just a garbage can with sparks coming out it. The sparks keep me warm. I don't condone what Dr. Zoidberg did… but I'll fight tooth and nail for his freedom to do it. Or I would, if I hadn't lost my teeth and nails on Mars and Saturn, respectively. Wait, you're a lawyer? You're hired! You okay there in the embassy, Zoidberg? No! There's no cocoa marshmallows! And every night, the rats eat a little more of my foot.",
"All rise for the Honorable Chief Justice Myrtle Foo and the associate justices! Counsel, you may address the court on behalf of Earth, if ready. I was hatched ready. Honorable judge heads, yonder crawdad done ate up our flag. I was doing freedom of speech, Earth's most sacred right. Your Honor, freedom of speech applies not what goes in. Can counsel cite precedent? Yes, darling, I can. In State of Alabama v. Giant Space lguana… chewing the corners off the Constitution.",
"He shut you up, O'Connor. Mr. Waterfall, you may present arguments on behalf of Dr. Zoidberg. Oh, God, I'm nervous. Two of my three hearts are having attacks. Court's kind of fun when it's not my ass on the line. Oh, land-o-Goshen. Your Honors, I'm not some slick big-city lawyer like my opponent here. But I am a veteran who has fought for his planet. You see this hand of mine? No, you don't! Because I lost my real hand planting the flag when we took back Halley's comet.",
"Yet it was worth it. I love it even more than I love my seven wives. That's right, I'm a polygamist… had I not used my intestine as a rope to hoist a flag made of my own skin… if it would protect the freedoms of the proud people who salute that flag. Freedom such as polygamy. I rest my case. The justices and I will now confer, using high-speed telepathy. By a vote of six to three… we find that flag-eating is not protected by the Constitution. Six to three? I beat the spread! The court orders an immediate public apology.",
"Just don't let it happen again. She means you, you turkey of the sea. Me, apologize? Never! I came to this planet to learn the meaning of freedom! who should get a nice lesson. So do your worst… because no punishment could be bigger than denying me my freedom! You are hereby sentenced to death. Wait, let me finish. Also, in a rare double-whammy decision, the court finds polygamy constitutional. I can't wait to tell my husband! Remember, men, take him alive so there's something left to kill.",
"This embassy is sovereign mud of the mud planet Decapodian! Invading these mud premises is an act of war! Yeah? Well, what are you gonna do about it, shrimpy? You wanna see, Mr. Bigshot? Attack Earth! Yes, I know it's a schlep. Just do it! Aha! Now the rubber band's on the other claw! Ready? Retreat! Deny my freedom, will you? to the Squash men of the Squash planet-Charleston Chew? All right, Kif. Let's show these freaks. runaway military budget can do. Bring me the codes for our global-defense network.",
"Aye, aye, sir. Commence lip identification scan. No tongue. We can't be too careful Rumor has it a double agent may be aboard this very ship. I'm watching you. You, ensign, what's your name? Hugh Man, sir! Hugh Man. Now, that's a name I can trust. Run down to the central battle computer and enter these codes. Sir, there's something about that ensign that's- You're damn right there is. That young lad's gunning for your job. And he just might get it. The enemy approacheth. Lieutenant, fire missile one and recommend me for another medal.",
"Make it gaudy. I'm going clubbing later. Sir, all planetary defenses have been disabled. Perhaps the Decapodians acquired our secret codes somehow. Well, Kif, stand by to take the blame. Dr. Zoidberg, how can you claim to love freedom, and then enslave all of Earth? Your planet doesn't deserve freedom… until it learns what it is to not have freedom. It's a lesson, I say! What the hell is this dirt pile we're building? None of your beeswax, slave. You'll find out soon enough.",
"Just focus on globbing that mud. I'm no good at being a slave. I'm thinking about graduate school to become a barber. This can't go on. It's already 1 0:00. Oh, you're right. Tomorrow is the day we fight back. Yeah, well, good luck, sister. All our modern technology is useless. I know I am. I'm having one of those things. You know, a headache with pictures. An idea? Back in my day, we didn't have your fancy all-digital weapons. We still managed to kill each other just fine. The crossbow.",
"A pitiless, elegant killing machine. The Bender of the 1 5th century! Not big enough. We need something that can take out an entire army. Something you could commit a war crime with- Earth slaves, behold the fruit of your laborsThe mobile oppression palace! I don't need to tell you that occupation forces are expensive. But with the mobile oppression palace… a few dignitaries can oppress your entire planet for pennies a day! Warships, dismissed! Do your worst, you sea devils! I'll make my stand with Ol' Freebie! You can crush me, but you can't crush my spirit! Oh, my spirit! Great-grandpa, no! Another victim of the mano-centric male-ocracy.",
"Ambassador Mervin, you killed my lawyer! You're welcome. He defended my freedom when no one else would. He was a good and honorable man. I request a satanic funeral. Is it possible that all this slavery and oppression. Is schmutzing up our freedom lesson? Take a pill, Zoidberg. Begin again with the crushing! You haven't won yet, Mervin! You didn't expect us to even go to a museum. this ancient heat-seeking missile! I don't even know you. Oh, it's gonna make such a mess! This is your secret plan? Heat-seeking missiles are useless against a mobile oppression palace.",
"All Decapodian technology All eyes on Zoidberg! Hey, I need that to smoke! Zoidberg, how could you? I used to think you were cool. Wait, people of Earth, listen! Yes, I'm desecrating a flag, but to preserve the freedom it represents. Zoidberg, you set us free! I feel like I could stand to hug you! I can't, but you know what I'm trying to say. Zoidberg! Zoidberg! Zoidberg! If only they appreciated freedom this much on my home planet. Wait a second. They do! Because this is my home planet! And now, to raise this beautiful new flag.",
"Dr. John Zoidberg! You're a nice man, Nixon. of the flag for tomorrow's papers? Oh, I couldn't. No, no, go ahead. You've earned it. Now, that's a grand old flag! All right, Zoidberg! I wonder what the Shroud of Turin tastes like. All right! Freedom!1 Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch Schman! The great rad spot is mega-sweet for party boarding. Indeed. Any calls while I was out? Yeah. You got a telesonic transmission from Kif a couple hours ago.",
"Oh, Amy, you're back. Another hour and I would've thought of hanging up. Why didn't you leave a message, I've left hundreds of messages with your answering machine. But you never seem to get them. Bender! It's not my fault if you don't check me. Messages erased. Oh, dearest, this long-distance relationship is too much to bear. When even an inch separates us, I quiver with misery. So you can imagine how I feel when it's a billion light years. Kif, don't cry, or you'll get a tummy ache.",
"Lieutenant, some things came off me and clogged the drain, so if you can- or is that my bosomy swan, Leela? Say again? You're breaking up. Good news, everyone. You'll be delivering pain medicine to the hive mind of Nigel 7. Scruffy's rolling out a large pill. You're going to Nigel 7? Kif's on patrol near there. You could drop me off on the way. We could, but we won't! It's a spaceship, damn it, not a prom limousine! Ooh! lf anyone needs me, I'll be in the angry dome. This is a very long trip.",
"I don't even breathe oxygen. Here I come, Kif. They jumped right out of their pants. Oh, what now? Activate glass window. Kif, I'm sensing a very sensual disturbance in the Force. Prepare for ship-to-ship intimacy. Yes, sir, captain. How about I help you finish that dream you were having about me? Okay. I was just at this partLet's try that a little lower and lots softer. Imagine you stowing away and stealing a licensed starship. Oh, it's so romantic it gives me the shivers.",
"I don't care how much trouble I get in. I needed to feel my lips pressed against your lip-less beak. Oh, Amy, I can't stand having a whole universe between us. I've been thinking a lot about this, and-Well, would you move in with me? Here? But, wouldn't it be crowded? Oh, no, no. It's really twice the size. You can use the floor and I'll have the ceiling. See? Kif, you have so much creativity and niceness. But I'm not sure if l- Before you answer, come thither. It can simulate anything you desire.",
"And nothing can hurt you, except when it malfunctions… and the holograms become real. Well, that probably won't happen I wanted to show you what life could be like if we were together. Computer, run program Kif One. Spirit! Kif, that's the pony I always wanted… but my parents said I had too many ponies already. Yes. I programmed it in for you. Four million lines of BASIC. And if this isn't the life you want, Run program Kif Two. We could live here at the shore of the Tranquilibrius Sea, in a time-share.",
"And I would pluck the moon from the sky just to see you smile. Seems to be sort of stuck. Run program Kif-colon- slash-slash-three! This isn't bad. My aunt had a place like this. in a bus station bathroom for all I care. As long as we're together, But before then, there's still lots I want to do on my own. Oh, dear. I fear the Holo-Shed might be broken again. Well, as long as we don't cross paths Look! Spirit! And there's Professor Moriarty. Jack the Ripper! Evil Lincoln! Right-o, gents.",
"It's another simulation gone mad. So murder and mayhem, standard procedure. Real holographic-simulated Evil Lincoln is back! The Holo-Shed's on the fritz again. The characters turned real! Damn! The last time that happened, I got slapped with three paternity suits. Listen up, history's greatest villains. Get back into the Holo-Shed before I start blasting. No shoot fire-stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! Spare me your space-age techno-babble, Attila the Hun. Kif, hold on! I totally want to! Grab on! Over here! Have a good one.",
"Oh, man! After all that, I could use some relaxation. I'll be in the Holo-Shed. Well, except for a few broken bones, some internal hemorrhaging… and a partially barfed up heart, everyone appears fine. Oh, and Kif is pregnant. Amy, isn't it wonderful? I'm pregnant. Yes, it's great. A great miracle. And not one of those bogus everyday miracles, like a sunrise. Aren't you a male? Just when I thought I'd figured out you biological creatures, it's something else! Let me at him! Get over here, Kif! You're- Look, I'm sure we're all a little unclear on how anyone gets pregnant.",
"So, Kif, pray explain, and don't spare the dirty words where appropriate. Well, it's quite simple really. When one of my species experiences deep feelings of love… we enter a so-called receptive state. You disgust me. Go on. At that point, our skin becomes a semipermeable membrane. of genetic material. I held Amy's hand, and voilŕ! But that better be all there is. Oh, Amy, you'll be a mother! What a wondrous affirmation of our love. And all from the touch of your hand.",
"Dude, hold up. Remember when Zapp blew a hole in the ship? Indeed. Kif touched everybody there. Couldn't any one of us be the mother? I mean, what about that, Kif? gotten pregnant that way. Or even from a toilet seat. since I have a private washroom. My home away from home. By the way, Kif, your flush seems to be set on stun, not kill. Look, Kif, I probably am the mother. Although maybe I'm not. Of course, I hope I am, but just in case I'm not, maybe we should have a test. A test! I demand a test! Even I laughed at me when I built this alien cross-species genetic analyzer.",
"Subjects, please enter the chamber. When I pull this switch, the materni-fuge will spin at 1 0,000 rpm… separating out everyone who isn't the mother- Father-Whatever. Faster! Faster! Good! Fry's ejection indicates that he is not the man mama. Nor is Captain Brannigan. Oh, thank you, merciful God. Zoidberg? What the hell were you doing in there? That's where I live. I have no home. Amy? But that means… Leela must have impregnated me when she grabbed my ungloved hand.",
"That explains the poster in hygiene classNo glove, no love. Wow, this is all so confusing. Our love has had to endure your constant hatred, and now this? Stop testing our love! Oh, please, captain. I thank Leela for the DNA she gave me, but in my species… the true parent is the one who inspired the initial feeling of love. We call that person the Smizmarr. And my Smizmarr is Amy. the uncle or something? Sorry I got your boyfriend pregnant. At least Kif's baby shower should be fun.",
"I better put it on my calendar. Thursday. Baby shower. Enter. Might as well plan for my new life Set motherhood mode. To motherhood. Zoidberg? My face was stuck in a pizza. Mom? Dad? I know this is weird, but- We don't care how squishy alien get pregnant. All we care is that we have grandchild. You're very open-minded, Mrs. Wong. Hey, you call her Grandmanow. Call me Grandma like crazy. Everyone we invited is here. Also Zoidberg. So let's open the gifts. I can't wait.",
"We'll start with this one from Bender. It's my booties from when I was a kid. Uh, they're already bronzed. They are bronze. And this one's from Leela. I wonder what it is. Yes, I wonder what we got you. It's a basket! For picnics? It means a lot to me. It's the basket my parents left me in at the Orphanarium. You could use it for picnics. Here, Amy, we get this one for you. Is it a new party board? It's a board, all right. An ironing board. We had your old party board converted now that you not be partying anymore.",
"You trashed my party board? Damn right. Now you a mom. The only surfing you'll do is under a big wave of responsibility. Oh, this is the happiest moment You all brought such wonderful gifts. But the greatest gift. Mine! For soon, the quivering mass of life within me will depend upon us both. Even now, I can sense it feeding, squirming, searching, questing. And shortly, it will rend my loins in twain… burst forth and pull us down, down, down.",
"No! I can't do this! When will women learn to take responsibility… for the children they've helped create? The quickening! My time is near. I must return to my home world to perform the ancient birthing rights. Let me know how that turns out. I must now embark on a perilous journey… to give birth in precisely the same swamp in which I was born. If it's so dangerous, I'd better go with you. A gal has to protect her DNA.",
"Tradition demands that I make this journey with my Smizmarr. And since Amy isn't here, I must go it alone. Farewell, for we may never meet again. My scrapes feel a little better now. Hey, what's this fat, ugly thing? A frog? A toad? Or your mama? It's a poisonous froad! No one move. The sacred ancestral birthing grounds Smells like a jockstrap. I am the Grand Midwife. I am Kif, of the clan Kroker, come to bear my young.",
"Where is your Smizmarr? She's not with me. Oh, the sorrow! Oh, the shame! Sorry, I'm probably just making you feel worse. As long as Amy is with me in my heart, I will have the strength of two. Apparently Amy hasn't been working out much lately. As the tea boils, please join hands with your beloved Smizmarr. Oh, right. Sorry, but I've memorized the ceremony by rote. It mentions her a lot. I'll try to endure. Good,'cause I'm not changing it. Now turn, ye two, and gaze deeply into each other's eyes.",
"What are you looking at? May the love I sense between you… at this moment remain with you both through all your days. The tea of new life is ready. Let those whose love created this life speak each other's names, then drink. Amy! ls it you, or have I gone crazy with loneliness? I still don't know if I'm ready for this, but I do know I love you. And I want to be here beside you. Great. Now I lost my place. I'm starting over! Oh, no time. It has begun. You can do it, Kif.",
"Oh, man! are they making it to the water? Stay away from my babies! The birthing is complete. Oh, thank goodness. I will now take my leave. I live here, so I won't actually be going anywhere… but you don't have to talk to me anymore. Congratulations. There goes my DNA. What a disgusting and beautiful process. That's birth for you. Well, we've given them a great start, And in 20 years, they'll sprout legs and crawl back onto land as children. I'll be ready then. 1 Less Than Hero FEMALE Your call is being- MALE Connected.",
"Reach out and touch the sewers. Look, Morris! It's Leela calling! for your big trip to the surface? We're excited, honey, but we don't want to embarrass you. I mean, your mother and I are basically monsters. Dad, relax. You are being so mutant. I found this adorable little bag to wear over my head. And it was on sale! No one's wearing anything adorable over their head. Now listen. I could never, ever be ashamed of my parents. I'll see you this weekend. the video phone with.",
"My parents! They're coming up from the sewers for a visit Sunday. Are you off your rocket? Your parents are mutants. It's illegal for them to come above ground… because they're inferior genetic scum. Present company excluded, of course. I'm getting them a special one-day surface permit from city hall. While you're there, could you get me a license to kill? Sure. Bare hands or weapon? What does piano wire count as? Good news, anyone. The Swedish robot from Pi-kea is here with the super-collider I ordered.",
"Enjoy your affordable Swedish crap. Let's see what tools we'll need. All right, we're all set. Nothing like the rustic wholesomeness of working with one's own hands. There. Finished. And only six missing pieces. Those Swedes know how to put in almost everything you need. Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went 1 0 rounds with mighty Thor. I've got just the thing. Genuine miracle cream… I bought from a traveling salesman. Come one, come all! he said. Step right up! This sounds too good to be true,He said I looked like a smart young man! So is it a deal?I inquired.",
"Two hours later, he was gone with 60 of my dollars! But I had the miracle cream. Bad news, nobody. The super-collider super exploded! I need you to take it back and exchange it for a wobbly CD rack… and some of those rancid meatballs. Do you have a minute? I live in Jersey City. My car broke down, and my aunt's sick. She needs this medicine, but I need bus money, so I'm mugging you. Hand over your wallets! I don't believe that story for a second. It doesn't matter, I'm mugging you! There's no bus to Jersey City.",
"Give me your wallets now, or my robot will shoot! Don't make me hurt you. I'm too scared to find my pocket. Here, I'll just take off my pants and give you those. Hey! I don't like what I'm seeing! Give it to him, Andrew! Give it to him again, Andrew! What the-? Laser-proof shirts, huh? Foiled. And after years of planning. You're out of the gang. How did we manage to survive? What gave us those strange powers? Maybe we're wearing magic rings, but they're invisible… so we don't even realize it.",
"Also, you can't feel the rings. Fry! Shut up and look at this! May cause super powers in humans. Wow! A super-powers drug you can just rub into your skin? You'd think you'd have to freebase it. Let's see, which powers do we have? Super strength? Yes, sir. Ability to command the loyalty of sea creatures. Hey, Zoidberg, get in here! Screw you! Ain't got that. Wow! Super powers! twice as many humdrum activities. Leela, I think you're missing the big picture. When you were a kid, what was your biggest fantasy? To have parents.",
"Whatever. The correct answer is, to be a superhero! We have super powers, and we're Americans. This is our chance. Hm. I have been looking for a way to serve the community… that incorporates my violence. You'll barely regret this. Hey! A friend of mine said he mugged you today, and you had super powers! It's true. Thanks to this funky-fresh cream. Now me and Leela are forming an awesome crime-fighting duo! Wow! Crime fighting! Cool! You say you're a duo? Yeah, duos are good.",
"Of course, sometimes they're a little short-handed. With two humans, you'd think there'd be a robot in there to balance things out. But whatever. I have these three costumes you could use, but I guess I'll just throw one away. We'd love to have you on the team. But aren't you more on the supply side of crime? Plus, the cream won't give you super powers. You're a robot. So? I'm already super strong, and my arms do thisAlso, I got this goingListen up, New New York! There's a new group of superheroes in town! And we're-",
"A new era of justice has begun. Attention all crooks, lowlifes and lawbreakers. Do yourselves a favor and crawl back into your filthy tenements… you human cockroaches, or get your ugly face punched to custard by. Captain Yesterday! Clobberella! And Super King! The best one of the three! Captain Yesterday, I find your skintight high-waters incredibly sexy. Let's get together sometime. Sure! I'm listed in the phone book, so once I reveal my real name.",
"Are you crazy? We have to keep our secret identities secret. From everybody? Especially from everybody! Give several reasons why. For one, superheroes cause a lot of collateral damage… and we don't want to get our butts sued. Or do we? No, I guess not. Also, if our identities get out, every crook in the city will be after us. Or, God forbid, our loved ones. Super King has no need for loved ones. How you doing, kid? There you go.",
"Two one-day mutant surface passes. Thank you, Mayor Poopenmeyer. Mayor here. What's that? A horrible crime in the works? Ruthless villain? Citizens in danger? That's fantastic news! Because I get to summon They're usually here by now. Well, so long. Keep in touch. Wait! Stay and meet the superheroes! There's three of you and three of them, so it'll be perfect! Is this clown on? Where are those daring crime-stoppers? Oh, I completely forgot! I left my apartment on fire! As for me, I'm late for my LSATs.",
"And I can't take life anymore! Clobberella! Captain Yesterday! My liege. You're just in time. We've received a tip that the Museum of Natural History… will be robbed tomorrow The targetthe priceless Quantum Gemerald. Who's the perp? A dangerous villain known as the Zookeeper… who commits crimes aided by a pack of highly trained animals! His crew includes a badger with a troubled past and nothing left to lose. An elephant who never forgets to kill.",
"And a seldom-used crab named Lucky, a. k. a. Citizen Snips. You can count on us, Mr. Mayor! Hold the elevator! We're in here too. Leela, how you gonna meet your folks tomorrow? We've already scheduled the Zookeeper for a 9 a. m. foiling at the museum. Not a problem. I've cleverly arranged to meet my parents… right there at the same museum Nine, ten, a big fat hen. The name's Bender. I can't believe the Zookeeper is this late for his own heist. It's just rude! I'm supposed to meet my parents, and I'm still in my secret costume! There they are! How can Leela not be here? Do you think she forgot? I'm sure she's just ashamed of us.",
"Yo, freak jobs! Hit the nearest manhole, pronto-like! up here. From the mayor himself. I don't know. I never heard of no mayor. The Zookeeper! Sorry I'm late. Long story. Now, everybody hit the deck! I'm cutting the entire line and stealing the exhibit! You're not stealing anything! Ah, the superheroes. Or should I say, super zeros? That was uncalled for. Animals, attack! Please do not feed the animals! You're going down, my friend! Down under! Man boxing a kangaroo is a peculiar spectacle.",
"But a kangaroo boxing a robot? Now I'm afraid you've lost me. Citizen Snips! Nice job, Fingers. I'm scared and confused. I think we wandered into an off-Broadway play. No, there are way too many people here. Later, if anyone asks when I got away, tell them right now! Forget it, Zookeeper. You're going into captivity! Fool! A quip about putting me behind bars would have been far more delicious! Here, catch! No, Fry! You can't fall fast enough! I don't got it! You saved the Gemerald! Yet the Zookeeper escaped, thus proving that the deadliest animal of all.",
"You can get off me anytime. Oh, no! My parents are leaving! I've gotta go change back into street Leela. Thank you, mysterious heroes! The value of the Gemerald you saved is slightly greater… than the cost of the damage A net gain for our great city! It's good that Leela doesn't love us. She'll be less sad when we die. And I got the audio tour for Treasures of Liberace's Tomb! Sweetie, it's okay. You don't have to apologize for standing us up.",
"I want to tell you why I didn't show up, but I can't. it was a very good reason. I'm sorry I disappointed you. Leela, you could never disappoint us. We're so proud of everything that you are, and we always will be. Because you're our baby girl. Oh, I can't take it! Mom, Dad, I'm Clobberella! Galloping gators! You're a superhero? Well, that's wonderful! the costume so revealing? Look at me! Proud dad of a superhero! We should print up T-shirts! And F-shirts for our friends with two arms on the same side! No, listen, it's very important that you never, ever tell anyone.",
"Dad, you drink? No, not even then! All right. My sucker is sealed. In fact, I shouldn't even be wearing this around here. It was brisk. I dressed in layers. That's my girl. So anyway, my daughter's Clobberella. Leela is Clobberella? You're pulling me! Keep it under your sock. It's a big secret. That's why I'm only telling you two. That guy's daughter is Clobberella! But don't tell anyone. Greetings, superheroes. Remember me? I don't remember much, buddy! And you're no looker.",
"Professor, isn't it time for your nap? Yes, damn it! Zookeeper, how did you know our real identities? Let's just say a little bird told me. Leela told her parents. Leela's parents blabbed. Leela? ls the person that parrot is mimicking telling the truth by proxy? Yes. My parents were so hurt, I couldn't help it. But I distinctly told them not to tell anyone. We are not amused! And here's something you may or may not find interesting. Leela, please forgive us! Especially your father, who's the one who told.",
"Thank you very much, Morris! Are you all right? Has he hurt you? No, but my allergies are going nuts. Every couch and table has animal fur all over it. He lets them climb on everything! All right, Zookeeper, what do you want? Why, the Quantum Gemerald, of course. You must steal it for me by midnight… or your parents will be devoured by piranhas that I have, shall we say… persuaded to walk on dry land. Save us, Leela! I mean, if you don't have anything better to do! We're out of options.",
"We have to steal the Gemerald. But should superheroes commit a crime? Even to save lives? I need moral guidance! Bender? The thought of stealing anything fills Super King with disgust. But if it must be so, then let Oh, no! Our super-power cream is out of itself! Check inside the cap. There might be a caked-in gold mine. I'm afraid we're boned. to change my superhero name? Just be cool. Nobody knows we're super-powerly challenged. Man, this costume is so damn heavy. Hey, Captain Yesterday? Can l, like, wail on you with this two-by-four.",
"Ow! That didn't hurt. Hi, superheroes. Everything okay? Big O, little K, my friend. Just checking if everything's all right. It's okay, all right. Okay, then. Grab it! Yo! The superheroes have turned evil! Most uncool! Stay back, or we'll beat the tar out of you using super powers! So this is your lair? Of course not! You think I'd show you my lair? My lair's a million times nicer than this. Well, here's your lousy Gemerald. That seemed unnecessary.",
"Our transaction is complete. Come, Solomon, to the lair! Mom! Dad! Oh, I'm so sorry I got you kidnapped… by a crazy madman who tried to feed you to piranhas. We're just happy to be involved in your life. No, no, it's my fault. For telling you I was a superhero. That's true. I just couldn't stand to have you think I was ashamed of you. That's sweet, honey. But it's natural for children to be a little ashamed of their parents. Just like it's natural for parents.",
"Not that we are. But you could call a little more often. And would it kill you Hey, Fry, we've still got our costumes on. Wanna steal some more stuff? As long as you think it's right.

"Surprised to see me back again so soon? I expect you'll want to see my angry, crotchety, grandpa discount card? Sir, this card has expired. But it's good for a lifetime. Well, yours expired. Oh, Lord! Teeth do not belong in your pants, professor. Well, I can't keep them in my mouth, they're nuclear-powered! Ow! It bit my finger. No! No! It's tasted human blood! Mm. Damn good meat. Professor, we've talked it over, and everybody thinks you're too old. We've decided to do the merciful thing, and have you youth-a-sized.",
"Dear God, no! Relax, professor. Youth-a-sizing is a trendy new spa treatment. It's this season's shark-cartilage enema! But I like being old! I don't have to talk to my parents, no one asks me to help move their stuff… I don't need to understand Okay, okay. We're not gonna force you until I finish this sentence. Get him! My thong! Hi! I'm Heather, your personal youth-a-sizer. Let's get started with a nice botulism treatment, shall we? Go to hell, Heather! In small doses, botulism toxin tightens and tones the facial muscles.",
"Instead of killing you in the most horrible fashion imaginable. Careful with the giblets! You're still retaining a lot of grump in these joints. More pressure. Since this is such a serious case of old, we'll try our strongest treatmentA soothing, full-body bath in searing hot tar. Sir, it's not necessary or wise to be naked. You sound just like my tennis instructor. The tar blisters the age right out of the body… in what top scientists suspect is a miracle.",
"I don't have time for this! I have to go buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it… making people wait behind me while I complain. He still sounds sort of old, sort of real old. Like everything else in life… pumping is just a primitive, degenerate form of bending. Come on, Bender! Pump harder! Harder! I'm trying as hard as I can. Harder, damn you! Well, that was an utter waste Professor, it worked! You look young enough to be my father! Fifty-three years old? Oh, now I'll need a fake ID to rent ultra-porn.",
"Cool, professor. We should go out and celebrate! Dear Lord! You've all reverted to your childhood forms! Hooray! I'm a teenage heartthrob again. While I try to restore our normal ages… I expect you all to go about your jobs like responsible professionals. It wasn't me, Mr. F. It was Amy. You stink! You know you did it! We're here to take my little stub of a husband home. Hermes, say goodbye to Mr. Farnsworth. Goodbye, Mr. Dumbsworth! Hey! This is my chance to spend time with my parents too.",
"But your parents are gross sewer mutants. Ow! When I was an orphan… I wished I could grow up with my mom and dad. And now, thanks to being hurled backwards in time- That's not what happened! Shut up and go live with your parents! It's gonna be totally awesome, Mom! You and me can bake, and argue about my hairstyle hiding my pretty face… and if some kid picks on me, my dad can beat up his dad! Can't I just beat up the kid? If you think you can put up with your father, then welcome home.",

"I'm just gonna stay in my room! Stay in room? You so fat, you gonna stay all around room. I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. I'm tired of you yapping! All you ever do is complain. You never try to make things better. Well, I'm running away from this dead-end family. I know there's a place for people like me, with new ideas.",
"There has to be! Fine. Get going. Oh, I'm going, and you're gonna be all, Where's Bender? I miss Bender! We won't know that until you leave. Oh, I'm leaving. There's the door. Ah. Do you have to shed your skin on the couch? What do we live in, a zoo? I'm getting the doorbell. For me? Hello, sir. It's a lovely evening you have tonight. I'm here to pick up your daughter.

"So where are you taking my daughter tonight? Well, whatever you're really doing, don't wake us if you get in after 1 2. Dad, you're being too lenient again. Okay, okay! You're the boss. No, I'm not! I'd like a sewer burger, but without the rat feces. What, are you on a diet? Jeez, Moose. Just dump me right in front of her, why don't you. Moose, Mandy, this is my friend Fry… from the surface.

And then a giant tapeworm tried to play us for chumps. But in the meantime, I have good news! I may have solved our age problem.",
"It seems the youth-a-sizing tar was saturated with time-altering kronatons. A thin layer is still stuck to our DNA… as well as Bender's robo, or RNA. Question. You stink. Yes, yes. Anyhow, I've designed an oil-eating bacterium… that should take the tar right off. Come on. Let's go tell Leela so we can grow up together. Thanks, professor, but I don't want the treatment. Don't you understand, you little nitwit? Unless you're treated soon, the only way to restore your true age.",
"He has a point, honey. What about your job and your friends? Do you really want to abandon your old life? My old life wasn't as glamorous All I ever wanted was to grow up here with you.

Everyone into the bacterial spew chamber. Yes, everyone do the same thing.",
"Initiating controlled infection. I'm no doctor, but this machine guy could use a lozenge. Ah, poo! We're even younger! Damn! The bacteria pigged out on the tar… and now they're getting freaky deaky… spreading kronatons throughout our systems! We're getting younger by the minute! What?

"Dude, the Fountain of Aging must be on the sun itself! Shut up! I was gonna say that. We've got to hurry. The kids have only one change of pants. We gotta be real, real careful to stay in just long enough… to make us our right ages again. Zoidberg, get out of there! The current! It's too much already! Help! Jeepers! Zoidberg is dead! Zoidberg's brother is dead. Funny story. I just reverted to the age when my siblings budded from me… and my brother Norman split off and jumped in the fountain.",
"Oh, no! Quick! Get them into the fountain! Thanks for the help, Leela. Once we're growed up, you can go back to your family. We'll never bother you again. Well, you could bother me a little. It's working! Hooray! I can't hold on! I'm coming in after you! You can't give up your childhood. You'll never have another chance at it! We're the right ages again! I think I might be a couple years younger! I'm still in mid-peril, you clods! He's too far out! We can't reach him! With my last breath, I curse Zoidberg! Are you back to your original age, professor? Even older! Huzzah! I'm sorry you had to give up being a kid, Leela.",
"Well, I guess every adult wants to be a kid again sometimes. But I worked hard to be the person I am. The fabulous person. With friends like you guys. Fabulous friends. And I'm really happy And you, my faithful fiend, how can I ever repay you? And that, little one, is how Papa gained his freedom. Now, bonne nuit. Bonne nuit to you all. The Why of Fry Delivery boy Philip J. Fry, reporting for duty. Dr. Zoidberg, soaking in brine. What is the meaning of this? We've got a delivery.",
"Let's move! Amy, mission profile. Interesting. Interesting. Dr. Zoidberg, mission bag? Packed and ready, sir. toy surprise I got last time. I can't work under these conditions. And without me, there is no mission. I am the mission. We're back from the mission. What? You went without me? You were looking up curse words in the dictionary. It seemed like a better use of your time. But I'm the delivery boy. Don't worry, everything went fine. Better than usual. Good work, team.",
"We really pulled together on this one. I'm real sorry I missed the mission. You might have needed me. But if I'd been there, l- Bender's great. by taking you out for dinner tonight. I met him at that charity cockfight last week. He's the mayor's aide. Oh, you go, mutant girl. I do go. He's a very important man. So? I'm just as important as him. It's just that the kind of importance I have, it doesn't matter if I don't do it. Oh, I'm nobody. There are guys in the background of Mary Worthcomics.",
"Buck up, meat loaf. Bender will take you out and cheer you up. What do you want to do? And I mean anything. You have the power. Name it and I'm there. You the man. Well, okay. Let's go bowling. Table for two? Step right this way. I'm afraid we don't have a reservation, but as you can see… I'm the mayor's aide. Table for two, please. Okay, then. It's okay, my man… I got you covered on your next health inspection.",
"Oh, I really appreciate that, Mr. Mayor's Aide. Here you go. Compliments of the house. Wow! Free bread at a restaurant! ls there anything you can't do? I can't fail the mayor. Not ever. Oh, jeez, I better not let Leela see me. Hey, I hear Fry. Boy, am I glad you're here. You are? Things aren't working out with what's-his-name? Actually, they are. Confidentially, I might not make it back to my apartment tonight. Could you walk Nibbler for me? And bring a baggie, in case he drops a steamer.",
"Have a great night. Oh, no. Please, no! Perfect. Whoa. Smells like a 289 in progress. Failure to scoop. Oh, yeah. Wait, I'm trying. It weighs as much as 1 000 suns. Don't worry. I'll pull some strings, see if I can't get you tried as a juvenile. I'm as worthless as this trashcan. You think I'm as worthless as you? Try catching garbage in your head and raising six kids, you dumb townie. Oh, Nibbler, at least I'm important to you… even if it's only because I clean up your poop.",
"The poop eradication is but one aspect of your importance. Indeed… and I have other amazing powers as well. Are you my mommy? Welcome, Lord Nibbler. Welcome acknowledged. I bring with me The Mighty One. At last, our centuries upon centuries of waiting have achieved fruition. Aren't you a fuzzy little guy? Stop that! Please, Your Mightiness. Mightiness? Are you off your nut? I got kidnapped by a bunch of guinea pigs. Does he not know? He does not know. He knows not? Knows not does he.",
"Not he knows? Enough! Fry, it is my duty to inform you that the fate of humanity… the fate of our race, indeed, the fate of all that exists… and ever will exist, rests with you. You are the single most important person in the universe. Oh, snap. On this auspicious occasion, let the horn of eternity cut a thunderous blast. The Feast of a Thousand Beasts is begun. You gonna eat that? Maybe later. matters of the gravest importance. Fry, do you remember some months ago.",
"I remember the dancing stomachs. That might've been a Mylanta commercial. Wait, the Brains! I do remember… but no one else does. They said I was crazy. You remember because you were… the only one immune to the Brains' mental attack. Because I'm so smart? Anyway, your immunity is due to the fact that you lack the delta brain wave. It's a genetic abnormality, which resulted when you went back in time.",
"I did do the nasty in the past-y. Verily, and that past nastification is what shields you from the Brains. You are the last hope of the universe. So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. For a thousand years, the evil Brains have been constructing… the lnfo-Sphere, a giant memory bank… twice the size of three ordinary memory banks.",
"They plan to collect… all the information in the universe and store it within the sphere. They're trying to learn things? Those bastards! Being brains, they feel compelled… to know everything, and soon they will. I'm as mad as I've ever been. Once their task is complete… they will ensure that no new information arises… in the only way possible. By destroying the universe. Now it's personal. Your mission is to infiltrate the lnfo-Sphere.",
"Then outrun the blast on this Scooty-Puff Junior. Okay, let's go through this once more from the- Brains! Fear not, Mighty One. Your missing brain wave makes you invisible to them. So long as you avoid intense thinking. Sorry, what? I wasn't paying attention. In a few seconds, the Brains will finish scanning… the last bits of information in the universe.",
"Beavers mate for life. Eleven greater than four. For quality carpets, visit Caplan's Carpet Warehouse. Now the lnfo-Sphere will open its protective crust… so as to scan itself, completing its thousand-year task. This is your one chance to enter the sphere. Scoot. Scoot now! I'm at the input console. I'm nervous, and I've got brain in my butt crack. Roger. Once you press the detonator, you will have 60 seconds for an exciting escape. Hey, wait. This Brain knows about everything, right? It will soon.",
"That's why you're supposed to be setting off a bomb. I can't pass up a chance to learn the answers… to the greatest questions of all time. Is it true that postage-stamp Correct, toad mucus. There's no time for this. What really killed the dinosaurs? Unauthorized data access. Detecting trace amounts of mental activity. or a cartoon viewer. Ew! Gross, cut it out. Odd, he is immune to our psionic attack. Impossible. We're an ambitious young squad with everything to prove.",
"It appears we are in the presence of the fabled one… but without his Scooty-Puff Junior, he cannot escape. A quantum interface bomb? Are you insane in the membrane? You got it, Poindexter. Oh, not good. Detonation in T-minus You fool! You will be transported to the other universe with us. Trapped there for all eternity. We'll form a tight clique that you won't be part of. Well, at least I did one important thing with my life… Ieading good to victory over evil.",
"The Nibblonians? Good? Ha. During your last moments in this universe, perhaps you should query… our database concerning the night of December 31 , 1 999. The day I got frozen? What about it? Don't ask about that. It would be boring. Forget it, then. Query! What happened to me, Philip J. Fry, on the night of December 31 , 1 999? Clarification request. Are you the Philip J. Fry from Earth… or the Philip J. Fry from Hovering Squid World 97A? Earth, you fat idiot.",
"Hurry up. Hello? Pizza delivery for… I. C. Wiener? Oh, crud. Uh, I can't believe how fat I look. Oh, Nibbler's there. Wait. What?! I-I don't understand. You made me go in the freezer tube? Detonation in T-minus 15 seconds. You little runts froze me. We can explain. No, you can't. Shut your adorable trap. We had no choice. You were the only one who could help us. What is one life weighed against the entire universe? Detonation in two, one- Will the owner of a white Pontiac Firebird-? Oh, never mind, zero! Well, here we are, trapped for eternity.",
"We could sing American Pie. Go ahead, I deserve it. I wish those stupid raccoons had never brought me to the future. I have shocking data relevant to this conversation. We don't care, you dope. We're in another universe. You're not in charge. It is possible for the Philip Fry to resume his life on December 31 , 1 999. Really? I can go back in time? There is a nexus point… at the space-time where you entered the cryogenic tube. You, and only you, can return there. Interesting.",
"You could stop the Nibblonian… from pushing you into the cryogenic tube. That is interesting. Why? never came to the future. You will have your life back, and we will succeed… in our plan to understand and destroy the universe. Everybody wins. The human returns to the past! Meanwhile… I love rocket skating, but the wait is always so long. Poor Fry once stood in line six hours Six hours? Sounds like a real nobody… but now it's time for somebody and some chick he's with to go skating.",
"You reserved the whole rink? Iet them know whose aide was coming by. The mayor's, that's whose. Mr. Vogel, I thought we was going skating. No, we're not important enough. Everybody just hold hands until the bus driver comes back from his haircut. What? Seriously? I'm trying to impress you with my clout. I know, and it's working. But think how much skating would mean to those kids. We came here instead of eating today. This might be their only chance to skate here their whole lives.",
"Who are we to say they can't? The mayor's aide and his badge. when you got connections. All right, little ones… back to the orphanarium. You can slide around the gym in your socks. So am I gonna get lucky tonight, or what? I hope your calculations are correct. Our calculations are always correct, for we are gigantic brains. Initiate space-time transfer. I hereby place an order for one cheese pizza. One pie, nothing good on it. Name? I-period-C-period Wiener. Talk a little louder.",
"It sounds like you got some kind of tiny head on you. Hello? Pizza delivery for… I. C. Wiener? Oh, crud. I don't understand. You came back in time to knock me into that freezer… and now I came back to stop you. I did not come back in time. But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. when I'm 1 000 years older. Not if you don't freeze me. Please, our sages foresee that in 1 000 years.",
"Since you will not live that long, I must freeze you now. Well, why couldn't you just ask me? We were afraid you would refuse. Of course not, I love the future. Then why are you choking me right now? Because I don't like being used. Well, now it's your choice. Is there nothing in the future worth saving? Hmm. Leela, but she doesn't think much of me. Oh, she must be The Other. You must not give up on her. I am stationed on a distant world known as Virgon Six.",
"Ten, nine, eight, seven. You think I had a chance with Leela? The present or the future? To save yourself or save Leela. One! Yes! Here I come, future. Oh, no, wait! I'm gonna get trapped in the lnfo-Sphere again. Just remember that Scooty-Puff Junior sucks! In 1 000 years, I'll get right on it. And so 1000 years later, Fry once again… infiltrated the lnfo-Sphere and set off his amazing bomb.",
"Only this time. Thank you for saving the universe, Fry. Here. Oh, thanks. If you ever need a savior again, just ask. I can't wait to tell everyone what happened. Yes. Incidentally, I need to remain undercover… so I'm blanking your memory. Did everything just taste purple for a second? you dumb poop machine. Bender, would you do the honors? Hey, Leela. I guess I got this for you. Oh, thank you. You know what? I don't care if you're not… the most important person in the universe.",
"It really makes me happy to see you right now. Then I am the most important person in the universe. The Farnsworth Parabox Oh, Lordy Lou! Help! I know you've rejected me a lot before, but frankly… I wasn't sure we were right for each other either. But now I am! So how about a date tonight? Sorry! I think I left my toaster on. One of you guys, do something! Come on, Leela. What's the real reason you won't go out with me? Help, Satan! You owe me! Look, I'm embarrassed to admit this, but you've forced me to.",
"I can't go out tonight. Because I have sweaty boot rash! Why do you think I'm sitting over here in the stink-free zone? Good news, everyone! I'm still technically alive, yes. But I need you to dispose of this crazy-ass experiment. You'll have to throw it into the sun itself. For only the thermal nuclear inferno of the sun… has enough energy to ensure its total destruction. That's not good enough. This one time I pounded a guy into the ground like a stake with a shovel.",
"So, what's in the box already? No peeking! I don't know what's in there. But I'm sure our minds would be unable to comprehend it. Ow! You hurt my collator! I don't care. Listen well. No matter what happens… no matter how great your curiosity, you are forbidden to look in this box. Forbidden! Pretty tantalizing, though. Whatever's in there, it's the only thing I've ever wanted. In my experience boxes are usually empty… or maybe with a little cheese And one time, pepperoni.",
"Scram, you lousy green snakes! Here, Leela. Take this and use it Right. If they try to look in the box. Whatever. Let's just forget about the box. The professor said to stay away. Fry, how can you be so naive? He was joking, get it? That's what makes it so funny! Okay, he wasn't joking. Now shut up and follow me. The butter in my pocket is melting! We thank you, Bender, for the gift we are about to receive. Tangled-up Christmas lights! We can take shifts untangling them! And unlabeled booze! I can guard the real box in peace now that no one's curious about it.",
"Well, I got through the night, and no one looked in the box. Not even me. The person who gave up her whole evening to watch it. A whole evening of TV, gone! What a mockery of justice… that I can't take even a little tiny peek. I need coffee. Okay, heads I look, tails I don't. Heads! I mean, all right, then. No. I have a duty not to look. Well, then again, I promised the coin I would. Deeper than a small box should be. Ouch! My lawyer will hear about this! What have you done? Nothing! What do you mean, why was I looking in the box? I meant your hair.",
"It's all different-y. Bender? ls-? ls that you? You know it. Large and in charge. Leela? Oh, there's a woman for you. Always dyeing her hair instead of not looking in a box. I didn't dye my hair. This throws my entire perception of reality into question. Clone? Robot? Or long-lost twin? Taking all bets! I also offer video poker! It's some guy wearing a Leela costume! You have this all wrong! I just fell into the box and then I fell out somehow. You shut up, sir! I know what's in the box! Oh, I've been as dumb as Fry.",
"I am not! It contains a parallel universe! And when you create a parallel universe. by evil twins. Now look, I am not evil. My loan officer said so. wouldn't you, Leela? Or should I say, Evilla? This is awful! Somewhere, there's a more evil Bender than me! I do my best, damn it! I want you to snoop around the other universe… and find out how evil they are. Here. I tell you, they're not evil. But don't be confused. They are jerks. Come out of your universe with your hands up! Oh, wow! It's like that drug trip I saw in that movie.",
"When I was on that drug trip. Astonishing! I must have created a parallel universe. Baldercrap! I created your universe! All you created was my fist parallel to your face! It doesn't matter who created what. The important thing is- We're exactly the same. I know all her moves. Therefore, I've got the upper hand. Now, now, perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Let's recap what's happened so far. As you can see, I accidentally created a box containing your universe.",
"While l, in a simultaneous blunder, created a box containing your universe. This is getting confusing. Why don't we call our universe Universe A and this universe Universe B. Hey! Why can't we be Universe A? We want A! It's the best letter! We called it first. Besides, this place kind of feels like a B, you know? All right, you can be crummy Universe A. And we'll be Universe One. Or the Mongooses. That's a cool team name. The Fighting Mongooses. Wait a second! lf everyone is identical.",
"Why did our Leela look into the box and your Leela didn't? Well, to be honest, I tossed a coin. It came up tails, so I didn't look. That's weird. Mine came up heads, so I did. Interesting. Apparently the key difference between our universes… is that coin flips That explains fruity here. I tossed a coin to pick my finish. Fog hat gray. Hey! Bite my glorious golden ass! You people and your slight differences disgust me! I'm going home. Where's that blue box with our universe in it? to your evil universe, wouldn't you? And destroy your box with our universe inside it! Nonsense! I would never do such a thing.",
"Unless you were already having been going to do that! You heard me! In any case, I've hidden the box, and it will remain hidden… until I'm convinced you're not evil. Everyone, keep an eye on your evil counterpart. And you all do the same! Can Fry and I watch our parallel selves together? We have plans tonight. You guys are dating? Oh, no, no. We're married. I got my eye on you, boy! Don't even think about it, lunch pail! You'd be dead before you hit the ground. Good point.",
"What do you say we just hit a strip joint? I was waiting for one of us Bender A, you're a prince among robots. Can you forgive me for distrusting you? I can't stay mad at what is essentially me. I love me! This is so great! I always wanted an imaginary friend! I'm not imaginary, I'm parallel. We're exactly the same, right down to the- Is that pink nail polish? Is that not pink nail polish? The professor's right, you are evil. And shallow. I am not evil! So, Fry, Leela, how'd you two get together? Funny story.",
"I asked Leela out a million times, but she just kept rejecting me. I have sweaty boot rashor I have to meet the president. Oh, man, you never heard such excuses. But, like a dope, I believed her. Looking back on it now, it's kind of funny. It sure is. Right, Leela? Funny? Then one night when Fry asked me out… the only excuse I could think of involved ghosts. I knew he wouldn't buy it, so I did what I do in those situations. Oh, Lord. I flipped a coin.",
"You mean you flipped a coin too? And it was tails? You really missed out on something, One year later I gave Leela a diamond scrunchy, and we were married. One year later I got beat up at a Neil Diamond concert… by a guy named Scrunchy! Well, that was pointless. Say, I hope you won't think it head wound. Oh, this old thing? I was experimenting to see if I could remove my own brain. Of course! I had the same idea. I flipped a coin to decide if I should proceed.",
"But it came up tails, so I didn't. Well, getting the brain out was the easy part. The hard part was getting the brain out. So tell me about yourself. Well, don't look into it, but I'm a respected internal-medicine doctor. A can! As for me, I design mansions, then live in them. I'm lying. I'm an appalling failure! Me too! A big fat one! And those coworkers, always looking down on us Zoidbergs. What are they, from Nob Hill? They're all like, Stop spraying me with ink, Zoidberg! Put on pants, Zoidberg! Don't touch our fancy box, Zoidberg.",
"Oh, that box! Too good for us, is it? from down in the gutter, they will… as King Zoidberg caresses their fancy box! You know, maybe a certain blue lobster saw where professor hid the box. Good news, everyones! After carefully reading the scriptures… we've concluded that none of us are evil. Yes, the Bible is the real good news. Anyhow, you're all free to go back to your own universe. What's going on here? Why aren't you all out destroying the professor's box? Hermes, aren't you curious that there's two of everybody? No.",
"Now, like my granny used to say in her tarpaper shack on Montego BayIf you want a box hurled into the sun. You got to do it yourself. Your granny can go to hell! I've hidden the box so no one can destroy the home universe. Oh, go on. Wait a second! lf your Hermes was about to destroy the box containing our universe. Then your Hermes. And sure enough. Like Granny said, If you want a box hurled into the sun.",
"You got to do it yourself! God rest her zombie bones. So we go back through the box and stop Hermes. Right. Good thing Professor B there hid it in the coelacanth tank. No one but a crazy lobster would look there. It's gone! All hail Zoidberg, the king with the box. Now it's my turn, maybe? The box says no. Meanwhile in Universe A, Hermes A heads towards the sun! Item onebox. Check. Item twosun. If I know parallel Hermes, he's at the sun by now! Our universe is doomed! Now, don't give up yet, you crybabies.",
"The box is gone, but we still have one preposterously slim hope. Is it a kind of hair spray? We must attempt to make another box containing our universe. Well, is that your universe in there? Hmm. All women. I'll put this one aside for later. We'll never find your universe in time! on my fat head! Yes, it's the apocalypse, all right. I always thought I'd have a hand in it. I'm not sad, because I finally found someone as great as me. make new friends, but keep the old. One is silver- And the other's gold.",
"Why with the long faces? I think she means you. Grab them! You coward! Wait for me! Look! Which one did they go into? Oh, let's all ask each other! That'll solve this problem! We'll each have to search a universe. Everyone, grab a length of wire first so you can find your way back. two smelly lobsters? We didn't see anything. Ever. Yo, did two shellfish in scrubs go by? BIG-HEADED Hell, no! BIG-HEADED Beat it, jerk! Have you robot versions of you guys seen any extra Zoidbergs around here? Access denied.",
"Hey, pal, look what I snagged from the Leprechaun Universe! Yeah, Leprechaun Universe is fine, if you haven't seen Pirate Universe! Faith and begorra! Quick, into another box! There aren't any in this universe, there aren't. Hey, you! What with the no boxes? Baby, they're somewhere. Everything's, like, somewhere. Place is kind of au naturel right now. There they are! Dig it! All of you fitting in this box is, like, seriously freaked up! Nonsense! Why, there's a whole universe in there! Dude, there's a universe in all of us.",
"Right on, Professor Freaksworth! Everyone, pull your wires! Hurry! Back to Universe A! Hermes, don't press that button! Later! So long, Your Majesty! There but for the flip of a coin So, Leela? Seeing how the universe wasn't destroyed… you wanna catch an ape fight? You know, together? Well, I guess you deserve one more flip. So heads or tails? You know, let's just say it's heads. Ready? One. Two. Three. Pull! There. That space-time eversion has given us their box, and vice versa.",
"What you think you just explained Correct! This box contains our own universe! Sweet honeybee of infinity! Bender, quit destroying the universe! Yes, all that is and ever shall be is in that box. And the box itself is probably worth something too. We must cherish it as we cherish every moment of our lives. Three Hundred Big Boys This Week in the Universe. Dateline, Tarantulon 6. The brave warriors of Earth… under the command of Gen. Maj. Webelo Zapp Brannigan… have achieved victory over the spider homeworld.",
"And to the victor belong the spoils. One trillion dollars in silken treasure. My fellow Earthicans, after meeting with top voodoo economists… l have decided to refund our silk surplus to you, the taxpayers. That's right, I've sent you each. in the form of a Tricky Dick Fun Bill. Knock yourselves out! I'm slightly richer! One $300 hooker-bot or 300 $1 hooker-bots? I'm gonna swim with a whale. They're the gentle giants of the deep. I'm well aware of that. Scruffy's gonna get himself one of them $300 haircuts.",
"This one's lost its pizzazz. A fortune, it is. At last, Zoidberg will live like a rich man! Get away from me. That's it! I'm getting Coffee machine, one cup of coffee, please. Leela, are you there? Oh, yes, you are. I'm hereby inviting you and your oddball coworkers… to a special reception to display the national silk surplus. I believe you know the heroic space stallion who captured it. He rented it with his tax refund. So, Leela, will you have the pleasure? What little there is to be had.",
"Tomorrow night at 8, then. No cheap crack houses for me no more! Very good, sir. Shall I pre-warm sir's crack pipe? Oh, Kif, it was so romantic of you… to rent this paddle plane with your tax rebate. We're like two dandelion seeds wafting on the breeze. Yes. Seeds. Wafting. I almost feel kind of shallow for blowing my rebate on this cool talking tattoo. Hey, Gordon Gekko. I cost as much as this whole crummy date! of a chore for me… to clean out my wrinkles each day.",
"Is it true that stem cells may fight the aging process? Well, yes. In the same way an infant One pound of stem cells, please! Of course, any age-reversing effects will be purely temporary. why is this Grand Cigar so pricey? Well, as you can see… its wrapper is a piece of the original U. S. Constitution. It was hand-rolled by Queen Elizabeth during her wild years… and was buried with George Burns until grave-robbing space mushrooms- Well, you know the rest. Give you 300 bucks for it.",
"No can do. Oh, all right. I'll just take these $300 burglar's tools, then. Very good, sir. So, what time you close tonight? Hey, Pops! Did that tax rebate come? Came and went. You're now the proud owner With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun. But, Pops, I don't want to have fun. I want to be like you, boring but prudently invested. Babylon's bells! I tallied almost 300 bananas on this entertainment product! Now you put them on and have fun. I don't wanna! Well, then, I'm gonna put them on and make you watch me have fun! See? Fun, fun- Hey! Turn that damn music- Isn't this fun? Try these on, sir.",
"I ask for rich-guy stuff, and you give me shiny pebbles? Well, you asked the right guy. Though, personally, I hate whales. Then why'd you become I don't know you well enough to get into that. $300, please. Noon tomorrow. If you're late, you tread water in the scallop tank. Guppy, trout, mermaid or-? Amy, I also spent some of my tax rebate on a gift for you. It shows the time wherever we both are, and it's powered by love. Also, you have to wind it. Oh! Somebody won big at Skee-Ball! I love it, Kif.",
"I'll use it whenever I want to know what time it is. It's Fry and Leela. Hi, Fry and Leela! Keep peddling! Oh, for the love of God, keep peddling! Bye, Fry and Leela! Oh! I can't wait till the tattoos on Amy's butt hear about this! Don't feel sad, my little tadpole. I'm trying not to. is in the belly of a whale.

"Freshen your coffee, sir? Yeah. Keep it coming. Put the pot down. Get away! You're so young in spirit. It's hard to believe you're as old as 25. The key is to grab life by the ho-joes.

"The garbage parts of the food. I ate garbage yesterday, and it didn't cost me $300! I'm not paying. Farewell, good sir. The Grand Cigar, she is mine. And with absolutely no consequences. Grand-theft tobacco. Time to get off our fat cop asses and ride. Hey, you. This fish is slightly too rotten to even make jambalaya. So far so good. Where's Kif? This isn't Yemeni! It's Sulawesi! The cup's shaking! I don't want my coffee shaking! You seem a tad wound up, buddy. And your face is greasy.",
"Real greasy. Been up all night? Of course I've been up all night! It was insomnia. I couldn't stop thinking about coffee. I need a nap. Mighty fine smokable. Fancy cigar.

Whereas Robot 1 X runs on pollution and emits pure oxygen… with a fresh pine scent. Man, that smells great! Now let's see how both robots do Sorting a jar of pocket change.",
"Total value $4.73 and one Albanian lek. Very good, Robot 1 X. And you, bending unit? I never got the change. Suckers. Presenting Mom's Friendly Robots. That new robot is great, huh? He sure made me look like a pile of crap. Indeed. That's why I bought one to help around the office. Let's try him out. Robot 1 X, can you clean Nibbler's stanky litter box? I can, and will. Hey, I could have done that I asked you five minutes ago. Come here, Nibbler! Look, Bender. If you want something to do, stop making out and give us a hand.",
"Go up on the roof and install this fake satellite dish. So we can impress the neighbors. Yes, sir! I'm on it. Oh, and have Robot 1 X help you. Get out of here, freshman! I don't need your help! Our owners asked me to assist you. When I screamed Help,I didn't mean you! I apologize. However, I was able to do your job before I saved your life. Don't mind me. I'm just saving you the trouble of throwing me away. Mell out, Bender. Come watch some TV. I can't. I'm stuck in the can.",
"Never! Why can't you accept his help? to make your life easier. Like a socket wrench, or a burglar's kit. I can't ask for his help because… I'm scared of him. Oh, sorry. Well, then, there's only one solution. You need an upgrade. with Robot 1 X's new technology. An upgrade? But I thought we all agreed I was perfect. Fry, didn't we agree I was perfect? Oh, yeah. No, you're pretty perfect. Pretty perfect? So you do think I need an upgrade. Yes, for God's sakes, yes! Fine.",
"I'll be back in a few days. Man, I hate those new 1 X robots. Yeah, right on, nut cake. Parole officer says I gotta upgrade, or he won't give me back my stabbing knife. But it's no big. I know it won't affect me. I love those magnificent 1 X Robots! The 1 X Robots are my friends. Wait. What happened to your enthusiasm for stabbing them? I'm past that. Later, blood. It's like he's not him anymore. You took away his robo-humanity! I changed my mind! But to what kind of a life? I'm too scared to get the upgrade.",
"But I can't face my friends again And so, I set sail for unknown shores. Oh, merciful Poseidon, take pity on this mechanical mariner. Curse you, merciful Poseidon! Boy, what is the deal with the ocean? A tropical island, huh? Well, I've washed up in worse places. Okay, first up, I'm gonna need to build a shelter. There. Well, I guess I'll go out for a while. Damn. One rock short of rescue. Low on power. Better fuel up. Oh, no! Guess I'll do what I always do when I run out of booze.",
"Okay, don't panic. I'll just make some yam schnapps. Now, turn around. Funny now hot. Beer! Who are you, and why should I care? Side A. We're a community of outdated robots who refused to upgrade… and came here-Side B. to live a simpler existence, free of technology. A working cartridge unit? Wow. You guys went obsolete years ago. Your mother. What Cartridge Unit means is, the things. also make us unique. I, for example, need to keep refilling my waterwheel.",
"Or I'll power-down forever. Oh, God! I'll never make it this time! This is the end! Anyway, we like it here. So, what's your problem? Not enough. Memory? Oh, great. Now I remember that word, but I forgot my wife's face. Oh, God! No! I want to live! you're welcome to join our society. Look, no offense, but I need technology, especially e-mail and snowmobiles. And television. Without television, how will I know what's buzz-worthy? Why would you want to watch TV when you can watch a snail crawl for hours? That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.",
"Oh, man! He's never gonna make it over that pebble! That was the greatest thing ever! Let's party. Yeah, baby! Come on! Where did you get that CD? It's one of my 1 0 desert-island disks. I never really thought I'd use them, but look at me now. Oh, yeah, baby! Gonna do that dance. CDs are unnatural. Why don't you just listen to the ocean? Which ocean? That ocean? Wow. It's like the Earth making sweet, salty love to itself… while all the fish groove on it. So much for this garbage.",
"Take that, Beethoven, you deaf bastard! Bang, bang, bang. You sure got this life thing figured out, cymbal-banging monkey. Hi, Bender. We know how much you miss technology… so we brought you this washing machine that drifted ashore. I'm gonna wash my linens so hard, What? I don't understand. Wretched technology has brought me nothing but misery. But Bender, you are technology. You're the most advanced thing on this entire island. Oh, it's true. I am a hideous triumph of form and function.",
"But not for long! Oh! That hurt! The downgrade is complete! Behold my handcrafted purity. The modern world can bite my splintery wooden ass! Welcome to your new life of simple tranquility. Forget that! I say the whole world must learn of our peaceful ways! By force! We're going back to civilization… to wage war on technology! Row, comrades, row! We'll stage an attack on technology… worthy of being chronicled in an anthem by Rush. We've been sailing for three weeks.",
"Maybe I should check our position with the periscope. Mirrors reflecting mirrors? High-tech sorcery! Sorcery, I say! Did you see anything? Yep, we're there. Prepare to surface! And now, technology shall taste the lash of the hickory switch! Technology is defeated! Let us return to the island and celebrate by counting rocks! Whoa! Whoa! No one wants to count rocks more than me… but our mission is not complete. Not so long as Robot 1 X torments me with his obvious superiority.",
"Ready the catapult, Sinclair! Aim for their power lines! They're the devil's veins, and electricity is his blood! Bender? lf we don't survive the attack, I want you to know I love you. Okay, fine. Fire! Oh! I'm blind! Professor, we have no power! What do you mean, no power? We're living in the future! I'd better light some candles. Friends, I've come to free you from your complicated lives! Free you from the complicatedpart, I mean, not the Iivespart. Oh, Lord, he's made of wood.",
"What now, Bender? I got a downgrade. I'm a steam-powered wooden robot, just as nature intended. Therefore, I must kill Robot 1 X! Does Mr. Bender wish me to destroy myself? I don't need your charity. Target Robot 1 X and fire! You wanged my ship, you walnut-paneled idiot! Try again, Sinclair. I said target Robot 1 X. Who's Robot 1 X? Launching. So I guess everything worked out fine. Great. Now we're being crushed. Help us, wooden Bender! Those guys hate fire! I gotta do something! What the-? Termites? Well, I don't need legs to save my friends.",
"I'll just use the old extenso-matic arms. Bender! Hurry! This fuel is expensive! Also, we're dying! I'm a-coming! Ow! Lousy primitive body! Oh, why didn't I get that upgrade? I'm an outdated piece of junk. Sir, might I recommend-? No, wait. I can use you as a tool to save my friends. And I'll still be the hero, who everyone says how great he was. Save my friends! And Zoidberg! Look! My hair got singed into an even cuter'do. Hey, where's Bender? Down here. I'm so sorry, guys.",
"I never meant to hurt you… just to destroy everything you ever believed in. Well, at least you saved us from. Thank God you finally overcame your incompatibility with Robot 1 X. Oh, yeah, we were totally in sync. I was like, Save them! And he was all, No problem. And then he did it. His new technology is great. I love those magnificent 1 X Robots. The 1 X Robots are my friends. It's like his personality is totally different now. Oh, maybe this upgrade isn't such a good idea.",
"Your upgrade is complete. But I destroyed the technology of the world. I ran on the beach and felt the sand between my foot-cups. Everyone experiences the upgrade differently. If that stuff wasn't real, how can I be sure anything is real? Is it not possible, nay, probable… that my whole life is just a product of my, or someone else's imagination? Well, I guess reality Yep. Oh, thanks, baby. 1 Bender Should Not Be Allowed on TV Here we go, y'all! Zoidberg, Zoidberg.",
"Zoidberg. This is a story about all my friends. Previously on All My CircuitsI'm sorry, Father. But somewhere along the way, I forgot how to be your son. Why, Antonio? Because… I have amnesia! Calculon! But I thought you were- Egyptian? Before I kill you, I must ask you one questionFor I have… Amnesia! Let me get this straight. Does anyone here not have amnesia? Not sure. I don't know. This show is awesome! When I grow up, I'm gonna have so much amnesia.",
"Me too! I mean, I have it now. But I forgot. Well, mine's louder! Cram a ham in it, you twerps! Sorry. I had it coming. Welcome, swingers! Pull up a groove and get fabulous! Nude rock bands, big piles of what I assume is talcum powder. It's quite a birthday party, Calculon. Cool! I'm gonna have a fabulatious birthday party just like Calculon! Oh, yeah? Well, I'm gonna show up looking good just like Monique. Do you two have to imitate everything you see on TV? We're 1 2. So, yes. Hold up, Cubert.",
"You're a clone of the professor. Do clones even have birthdays? Dad? Do I have a birthday? Hmm. You didn't have a birth, so technically, no. Oh, don't feel bad. We can celebrate the day I extracted you from the cloning tank. Or the day I scraped your DNA from that growth on my back. That one! It was 1 3 years ago next week. I used this very fork. Oh, well, isn't that- Hey. Next week'll be my birthday too! That's true! lf only there were a way to have one party for both of you.",
"Here at the office, then write it off as a business expense. Something's happening on television! Oh, Monique. Why did we wait so many years to bathe in champagne? Father! I've discovered the shocking secret… Mother has kept from you for 200 years! Brace yourself, for when I speak these words… you may well suffer an attack of explosive amnesia! For you see, the horrible secret is- Whoever's directing this is a master of suspense! Let's get hims out of heres.",
"We nowjoin America's most popular show in progressEverybody Loves Hypno-Toad! This show's been going downhill since season three. Look who's here, everyone! It's Zoidberg, the lovable tramp! Since when are you performing at children's parties? Performing? What? Please, if someone could spare me money to buy shoes? This party pukes. The guests were supposed to be here three hours ago. Well, that doesn't mean that no one is coming or that you two are total losers. All right! They must've all come as a group! Welcome, swingers! Pull up a groove and get fabulous! Good day, fellows.",
"Someone dumped this invitation in my begging cup. Happy growth-scraping day to all! fire them all. Guys. Guys. Something's happening on television again! Welcome to Entertainment and Earth lnvasion Tonite. Across the galaxy my people are completing a mighty space fleet… that will exterminate the human race! But first, this news from Tinsel Town. Following Antonio Calculon Jr.'s breakdown on the set… the popular TV show All My Circuits will hold an open casting call.",
"For child robots to replace him. An open casting call for child robots? Tinny Tim! Are you thinking what I'm thinking? What's that, sir? That l, Bender, am perfect for the role! You raised my hopes and dashed them quite expertly, sir. Bravo! Bender, your swarthy Latin charm will only get you so far. There's a lot of famous child acting units here. Look, there's Macaulay Culkon! He's just not cute since he got puberty installed. There's that robot child actor who grew up and robbed the convenience store.",
"And there's that robot child actor who grew up… and became a convenience store. Lottery ticket, please. We're ready for the first audition. Emote-atron Jr. ? Hold on, precious. Let's make you look nice for the lady. No. more. hanging. wires! In this scene, you've just found out your real father… is Calculon's fourth evil identical septuplet, Sleazy Martinez. Okay? Take us there! Now that I know the truth, Father, I must ride south.",
"We want Bender! Boo! audience seems to have turned on him. But I don't think- at Veracruz. So if you'll kindly hand me my poncho- Boo! Bring on Bender! Boo! Bender's the greatest! Sorry, kid. You're flailing up there. Ninety actors and they all got booed. Bender I keep hearing about. They say he's the greatest. Well, there is a robot named Bender here, but he's much too old for- Send him in forthwith! Boo! Not as good as Bender! Boo! Mr.",
"Bender? Have you ever been on TV before? Once, when I took those hostages. I saw that. You were good. Let's hear you audition. Bandidos? Oh, this is great. Because I happen to have a flawless Spanish accent. I will see. Adiós, Padre. Come, Jesus, Tonight we eat That was so terrible I think you gave me cancer! I don't care how popular you are, you will never work on my show! Yay, Bender! We demand Bender! However, you've got the job. Welcome aboard, son! Father-O! I'd like you to meet our director, whose name I never learned.",
"Yo. I read the script, and I think it would help my character's motivation if he was on fire. Don't worry about the script, baby. We rewrote your part to suit your acting abilities. So now my character has a British accent? No, now your character's in a coma. Get in bed and don't move. And action! I could've been British. Alas that mine only son should sink into an irreversible, permanent. Permanent? That's completely out of character for Antonio. I'm getting up.",
"Curse the tragic wildebeest accident that- Hey, everyone! Antonio here, but you can call me Bender! I got ants in my butt and I needs to strut! Come on, baby! Come on! I'm not familiar with the type of thing I'm seeing. Bite my shiny metal ass! Yeah! Come on, baby, yeah. Come on, yeah! Cut! That's the worst coma acting I've ever seen. We'll have to shoot it again. No. No, no, no. I don't do two takes. Amateurs like you do two takes. I do one take. Print it. I'll be in my three-story trailer.",
"Bite my shiny metal ass! Yeah! Come on, baby, yeah! Come on, yeah! Now, that's hospital dancing! Pretty good, hey, Calcy? Good? I've seen better acting from extras in Godzilla movies. I didn't shoot this. We didn't. That's security camera footage from your dressing room. He stole the scene and my money? I demand you fire this felonious ham! The network execu-bots are coming! Oh, dear God! Presenting the president of the network! Greetings, gentlemen. You already know my execu-bots.",
"Executive Alpha, programmed to like things it has seen before. Programmed to roll dice to determine the fall schedule. More reality shows! And Executive Gamma, programmed to underestimate Middle America. It's funny, but is it going to get them off their tractors? Now, who put this obnoxious dancing robot on my network? We were about to fire him, sir. Silence, hack! We've been monitoring our Nielsen families carefully. And during the 12 seconds Bender was on-screen, viewer eyeball focus.",
"But, sir, children watch this show. Bender's no role model. He's a filthmonger. At our network, we love filth. Filthy rich, that is. Being filthy rich, that is. Bite my shiny metal asscould be a catchphrase. Eighty percent likely. It will play in Peoria. Game shows are back! We need this edgy, sweeps-ready robot on our network! Bender, can you continue to drink, smoke and steal things on TV? Yes, I can. TINY TIM-Yeah, shooting! All right! I jacked from my dad.",
"A cigar?! Ripping! Look. I'm Bender! Ras H. Tafari! What's going on here? The ruffians smoked one of your cigars. That's not a cigar! And it's not mine. Hey, Dad. Bite my shiny metal ass! What? Such an act would be most uncomfortable for both of us! Where did you learn such language? From Bender, my good jerkwad. Bender? That guy's really starting to twist my dreads. Okay, okay! Get ready for this part! Quiet, robot. Bender's on TV. Oh, Calculon. It's so good to get away from the city.",
"And try this, kids at home! Is television sensation Bender a bad role model for Earth's children? That's crazy. A new protest group, Fathers Against Rude Television, says Hell, yes!What kind of bozos would start a Bender protest group? Good news, everyone! Hermes and I have started a Bender protest group! That was uncanny. Fathers Against Rude Television don't want our kids watching Bender's high-definition filth! And for what? Some kind of cheap laugh?",
"No, sir! Not us F. A. R. T. ers! You can't censor me just because I'm an obscenely bad role model. As unclean as it makes me feel, I agree with Bender. Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. Our dads are all pumped up on dork-osterone. We're just trying to be cool, like Bender. Yeah. And it's not even working. Smoking and drinking make us barf. Gentle jerkwads… I know how to emulate Bender without barfing.",
"We could commit a burglary. Bender loves to burgle! Hold up, though. Who could we rob? We don't know anyone with cool stuff. Duh. We know someone who runs on pure cool fuelBender! We'll rob Bender! You're watching Futurama… the show that does not advocate the cool crime of robbery. Okay. It's crime time. Hey, Bender. Hey, Bender. Hey, Bender. Hey, Bender. What's going on in here? Oh. Now I'm really outraged! Where did you requisition this party? And Zoidberg, what are you doing here? I'm networking.",
"Let me give you my card. We just invited a few friends over. There's something wrong with your story, but I can't put my finger on it. Of course! You don't have friends! Yeah! Why do these popular kids consider you cool all of a sudden? We're just cool, is all. Balderdash! using the Cool-o-meter! Good Lord! I'm getting a reading of over 40 mega-Fonzies. Everybody out! So do you guys know about anything else going on? Because I'm totally still ready to party. There's enough cool stuff here to furnish a happening pad.",
"Where did it all come from? Don't tell, comrades! All for one and one for all! Oh, crumb. What? What's going on? Our boys have taken up stealing. One of the worst and coolest of crimes. And all from watching you on TV, you cool jerk! TV would stink if everyone on it was a positive role model. Bender is about entertainment, baby! You can't hold me responsible… for what kids do when- That's the last straw! Bender should not be allowed on television! Bender must be stopped! I've gone too far! Who does that guy think I am? That's right! Come on! We're gonna march.",
"Make them stop forcing their filthy me down our throats! Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with- Bender! Down with Bender! As a doctor and captain. I now pronounce you man and wife with six months to live. Listen up, Hollywood! We're an exciting new mob! You better believe it. Great Shatner's ghost! We demand that all TVs be equipped. that blocks Bender from appearing on the screen! I'm afraid the answer is a gritty, in-your-face no.",
"Then I quit! Then you don't quit. I think you'll be finishing the scene now, Mr. Bender. And don't skimp on the nasty. There'll be no further nasty! We still have the option of resorting to violence! What makes you think that'll work? I saw it on TV… in that episode where Bender shot Calculon. How cool was that? Yeah! Come on! Do the scene. I'm a cold-blooded punk! I once put a laugh track on a sitcom that had no jokes in it. Hey, look! The prop guy has a lamp! I was using that! Listen up, because I've got You, cameraman, keep the camera rolling! You, director! Give me my motivation! You're angry.",
"Perfect! Viewers of the world, do smoking and drinking on TV… really make me cool? Of course they do! How about committing crimes and violence? Again, the answer is yes. But do we really want our kids exposed to that kind of trash on TV? I say absolutely not! On the other hand, most, perhaps all, the blame rests with the parents. That's right, you! And so I ask you this one questionHave you ever tried simply turning off the TV… sitting down with your children.",
"We're just so busy. And cut! Good enough. Splice in some reaction shots of me and shove it on the air. Have you ever tried simply turning off the TV… sitting down with your children… and hitting them? Well, I'd say we all learned a valuable lesson about TV there. a little less seriously. And more importantly, turn it off once in a while. Hear, hear! Darn right! So should we turn it off now? Well… That depends what's on.",
"One now. Nothing good. Let's just keep watching. On the count of three, you will awaken feeling refreshed, as if Futurama had never been cancelled by idiots, then brought back by bigger idiots. One, Professor, my fry-fro is all frizzy. Oh also, I'm covered with severe burns. Well. Why is. those things? You mean you don't remember? Nope. Nothing. It's like I passed out in college, except no one drew magic-marker penises on my forehead. Well, I suppose it's for the best.",
"Considering the unbearable horrors you've endured. Let's never speak of it again. It all began a few days ago. We were interstellar fugitives on the run from the law. Fire all weapons and open a hailing frequency for my victory yodle. And so, as you and Leela kissed goodbye in a tender display of tonguesmanship, we plunged into a massive wormhole. Never to be seen again. Yeah, we're back. Sweet coincidence of Port-au-Prince, we're back at Earth! Of course! That was the Panama wormhole! Earth's central channel for shipping! How humorous.",
"Yes, it's sort of a Comedy Central Channel. And we're on it now! We've lost power to the forward gameboy. Mario not responding! Brace for emergency landing. Roger that. Activate safety-spheres! Also mine has airconditioning. Yet thanks to my trusty safety-sphere, I sublibed with only trivial braindabglid. And the others? Right here behind this horrorcloth. Are they dead? No, no, no, no. Much worse. corrected by gloriabg Move over God! Prepare for rebirth. Wrong switch. Come on stem cells, work your astounding scientific nonsense.",
"Aren't those controversial? In your time yes, but nowadays Besides, these are adult stem cells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stem cells. Hermes Conrad! O' man, I'm dripping with placenta. Good thing it's casual Friday. Amy Wong! Indeed. Dr. Zoidberg! Hermes, my friend! Let me cut off your umbilical cord. And the rest! Hooray! We're back in bussiness. Over my dead body. Eh, nevermind. Bender, are the stem cells working? I'm dying. I need mouth-to-ass resuscitation.",
"I'm on it! It's not working! I die happy knowing you fell for that. His power supply is shut. He's flatlining! Only one thing can keep him alive. Possibly this thing. Whoo! I've never felt so energetic. I showed all up in you puts out 15 gigawatts. That's ten times your recommended. Who are you, my warranty? For God sakes Bender, keep dancing! Keep whooping it up! You must burn off the doomsday energy as fast as it's produced, or it will build to critical levels! You don't mean If you stop partying for a single second, you'll explode and kill everyone here in a fireball melted gears and splattered bones! Sounds like a party, baby! Hey, speaking of splattered bowels, can I cook you a romantic dinner tonight, Leela? Where's Leela? Is she ok? Why hasn't she acknowledged my dinner offer? Something's wrong! She's not responding to my poking stick! Poke harder, dammit! I'm poking as hard as I can! I'm sorry Fry, but I'm afraid Leela is in an irreversible coma.",
"My soulmate is gone. Why should I go on living? Because the pain slowly fades, but the love is forever. But what if I forget the sweet sound of her voice, or the moist touch of her eyeball on my lips? Are you still hung-up on whatshername? Move on already! Maybe you're right. Maybe I'm always right. Build-a-bot workshop. It's time to start living again. At least it's something to distract me from Leela. Now that I like for some reason. I like jelly beans. Do you? I sure do honey. Come now Fry, you can't live out this sick fantasy.",
"Not without our help. These security tapes record everything at planet express. Including the ship, shower and urinals. At yet it still hasn't stop the illusive bathroom burglar. Maybe he's just trying computer, analyze tapes and and extract personality profile of one Turanga Leela. Analyzing. Analyzing.Checking my e-bay bid. Analysis complete. Hey, I was nuzling that. Attributes transferred. Brace for an emergency landing! What? We survived the crash? Oh Fry! Party people in the house say.",
"This is wonderful. The last thing I remember I was dying in an explosion. Yet here I am in the flesh, more alive than ever. You better tell her, Fry. Anyway, my work is done. I'm gonna hit the showers. Nibbler. Come give mama a hug. What the.Bad Nibbler, bad Nibbler! What're you doing, pooperdoodle? Am I really just a robot? I mean, I have Leela's memories, her opinion of gazelles majestic. Her emotions confused and hurt. I swear, I didn't know this would happen. The only thing I truly know is I mean her.",
"Wait, help me out here. Do the Bender, do the Bender. No thank you. The truth is Fry, I still have feelings for you. But are they really my feelings? Am I just an automaton, or can a machine have sufficient complexity, legitimately achieve consciousness? I agree. I need some time to figure this out. Until then, friends? Listen up disco-dummies! You just flunked out of Bender's College of Party knowledge. Do the backdance, do the backdance. Good news, everyone. I'm going to make one final attempt to awaken Leela.",
"After all, there's always hope. No, don't get your hopes up. Frankly, she's just a brainless mound of scabs and puss. I didn't need to hear that. No and you don't need to see this. Well, that's it. I'm afraid traditional medicine has failed. No! I refuse to give up! Fry stop. She's gone. Dr. Zoidberg, can you note the time and declare the patient legally dead? Can I? That's my speciality! As you all know, Leela's living will States that in the event of coma, her body is to be fed to the wild cyclophage, a highly endangered creature that eats only cyclopses.",
"Yup, that's what her donor-card says. The beast approacheth. Bender cut it out. People are trying to have emotions. You think I wanna party? I'm sick of partying. Wohoo! More partying! Bender! Shut the hell up! Bender! Stop shutting the hell up! Oh, right. Leela's back, as if I care. Woo. Alright, Leela! Thanks. It's so nice to wake up and see.And can you believe she wore a tanktop to my funeral? Shut up! We got to get out of here! No, you shut up we got to get out of here. All aboard the party-ship! There's no room for two Captain's Butt's in this chair.",
"There would be if you'd taken a spin class instead of just lounging around in a coma! This is crazy. It's like I'm looking at an exact robot duplicate of myself. That is what you're looking at. Oh. How could you do this Fry? I have to go. This is just too freaky. Please don't get upset, Leela. She's nothing like you. I have to go. This is just too freaky. I need chearing up Bender. I don't know, you want to go out and party tonight? I hate partying! If only I didn't have so much cronk in my donkydonk.",
"Why does everything I date run away? I love Leela, always and forever, and if I loved robot-Leela too, that's only because she had so much of the real Leela in her but obviously I was wrong as usual. Wrong again. You were right. I've been thinking Fry. If I lost you, I don't think I could stand it either. I'd probably build As long as robo-Leela's not a jealous type like me, things will He's mine! Somebody do something! Here, take this! A gun? Do I really need to.Shoot her! She's the robot! No! Shoot her! She's the human! But how do I know who's the human and who's the robot? Ok.",
"Fine. If you're gonna be like that, I'm not shooting anyone. Right between the lungs. Man that was close. I'm a robot too! Aha! That explains this growth on your driveshaft! Who knows. Oh, I do. Allow me to explain what really happened the day the ship crashed. I'll protect you Leela. My love is stronger than the vast majority of explosions. Fry did in fact save Leela, though at a terrible cost to himself. I tossed him into the stem cells, like flem on a hot sidewalk. Leela was so distraught, she went all blade runner and built a duplicate.",
"Then uploaded Fry's personality from the urinal surveillance tapes. I sure love Leela. Alas, in recreating Fry's adorable jelly-belly she had overstuffed him with copperwadding. The innevitable static discharge electrocuted Leela and destroyed both of their short-term memories. by these things I already knew. What could I do? I hung up Leela with the other bonebags and went to procure the final ingredient for my stem cell brew. Professor, my fry-fro's all frizzy. My God, I can't believe I'll never see that particular Fry again.",
"Hey where's my shoes? Fry? Oh I'm sorry. I didn't realise I was already here. Trust me, don't ask. Ok dork. Listen, I'm gonna hit the urinal, Hang on. It's time to sort things out. The truth is, I love Fry. That Fry. And I love Leela. Any Leela. We're robots and we're in love. Hasta la vista, weener. We'll be back. For our stuff. Why did their voices change?

"The sphere then fired some kind of hellish blackout ray. Erased that planet like 18 minutes of incriminating tape. I understood why. Why I should care. Because the death-sphere is now on course for Earth. Aroo! My God, we're defenseless, like fish in a barrel. Options?

"So this is the trail mix Fry gave me! Yes. I exaggerated when I said I picked it from the treetops. I just wanted you to think. A little better of me. Well. your motives were good. And we were both loopy from dehydration. You've been doing an awful lot of urinating.

Then why didn't you give me any? help you forget your intense hatred for me if you were a teensy bit delirious.",

"Rebuttal, Professor? This four-dollar coffeepot but what he describes is perversion! You wouldn't know perversion on your testicles! You're just jealous,'cause you've never known true love. Oh, no? Back when I was full of piss and vinegar, and my bed wasn't, I feel in love with the sweetest girl ever to skip through Her name was Eunice, and we spent out blissful days working in a lab, developing a poison to wipe out that dreadful posie infestation. I thought our love would last forever. But then, 43 years later, she left me.",
"You hate robosexuals'cause your girlfriend left you for a robot?! She didn't just leave me for a robot, she was a robot! Oh, God, her name wasn't Eunice, it was Unit! Unit 47!

And now they're hugging me back.",

Da Vinci was history's greatest artist and inventor. He invented flying machines, war engines, submarines. Uh-oh. Nibbler died in the wall. That's not Nibbler. That's my most precious possession. Leonardo's beard! I paid a fortune for it at an auction of historic body parts. Oh, I suppose if I have an that same auction.",
"Indeed so. Most indeededly. Careful with that, you fool! What is it Professor? It's Da Vinci's fabled lost invention. Even the scholars who wrote of this device had no idea what it was for. And now, at last, neither do I! Maybe we can figure it out. Well, I may not have brain smarts, street smarts. I was in the hospital two weeks. No one visited me. I'm trying to deduce the function of Da Vinci's lost invention. Not even a card. He might have hidden a clue in one of his other works.",
"Ergo, I sent Bender out for a copy of The Last Supper. Everybody at Kinko's was an idiot, so I just brought the original. Jesus Christ. and his 12 Apostles. This hand here doesn't belong to anybody. And it's pointing a knife at James the Lesser. That's the great thing about that hand. And what about these funky table legs? It's like they're from some other, funkier painting. Maybe Da Vinci painted over something else. It's called a pentimento. That's true, Dr. Zoidberg.",

"Enough of your lies, Saint James. We saw you in The Last Supper. The great man Leonardo built me as an artist's model. When I took repose in this coffin, I carefully tossed the real Saint James in yonder heap. I'm sure you have many questions.

I'm so scared! Bring it on, dum-dum! Let's see how hard you're laughing when my doomsday machine chops off your face! Leonardo, stop! I want in on this! Are you crazy, Professor? I hate these nerds!

"One more teensy drink to help Amy relax. Still a little nervous? She's a nervous wreck! Well, I may not have a man, you and I had a talk. You can't break up with me. You're my pet. As much as I enjoy being of your misplaced affections, a highly sophisticated being who longs for intelligent conversation. Aw, is shnookums not feeling shtimuwated? An understatement It's time you treated me with respect. If you want to be treated like a fellow crew member, fine, but no more purse rides and no more dressing you up in your cute little sailor suit.",
"I keep telling you, that's my real naval uniform. Your place or mine? But first, this place. Ooh! Room for one more? I thought I set you for 7:15. FEMALE Sorry. I hooked up with Bender last night. Dude was all over my snooze button. But my doctoral exam is in ten minutes. on Mars! Ew! Kif, did you yack on the floor? Where's your candidate, Farnsworth? I have a long list of students to humiliate today. You're late, Miss Wong.",
"Here, take my lab coat. Allow me to introduce your examining committee in descending order of grumpiness. Professor Ogden Wernstrom. Wernstrom. Downtown Professor Ethan BubblegumTate. I see by your curriculum vitae that you're a Sagittarius. And Professor Fischerpreis Schpeeknschpell. He proved that 50 years ago, and he's been coasting on it ever since. Professor Morris Katz, and you are wasting my time. Proceed. Imagine, if you will.",
"A gigantic spherical generator, one that could provide unlimited energy because it's essentially in perpetual motion. Young lady, have you been drinking? but that's not revelant. I'm talking about Earth. Earth's the generator. is the whole world. To many young men in the inner city, it is. As it spins, it's producing an enormous magnetic field. to generate electric current, we could actually harness the Earth's rotational ener-ener. Kerchoo! Yes, tapping the earth's ener-kerchoo.",
"Go on. Sorry, I'm super allergic Professor Katz, would you mind. ? Miss Wong, I I mind everything. You just need to polarize the Earth's core with a huge. static charge. by ratcheting superconductive wire down into. Sorry. Enough. The committee members will now vote yea or nay. Hell, nay. The horse says, Doctorate denied. I don't have a fancy degree either, but today I'm a prominent boy in the package delivery field. and equal member of the crew, my perspicacity, and dare I say it, my friendship.",
"Leela, muzzle that skunk. We can't stop a meeting for You again? you mangy ball of histamines. You leave kitty cat alone. trying to run a business, Aw, its anus looks like an asterisk. Captain Fuzzy Toes reporting for duty. I mean, cutie. My best friend died in that uniform. If I had a spray bottle, I'd give him such a spritzing. I'll tell you one thing. nothing acts that cute without some ulterior motive.",
"Aw, you want your dipey changed? its every move. Powder, please. Here's my new theoryThat is one adorable cat. I do miss being Leela's shnookums. I'm going to apologize and hope for a pity pet. Yes, my lord. Amy and Nibbler are They must be spayed and neutered, wespectivewy. We have proof. It was summoning a saucer. Of course it wanted a saucer, you idiot.",
"You fool, this isn't about the cream. It's pwonounced cweam. I'm petting mine down to the bone. Just stwoke its fwuffy fur. Scwatch its fwubby chin. ALL No, no! What do cats need with that much yarn and cobalt? They're doing something downstairs. We've got to find out what. Where do you think you're going, No-cat? Uh, the basement. I think I left the air-hockey table on. you ain't going nowhere. Can you at least tell us what's going on down there? We're certainly not building something sinister, if that's what you're implying.",
"Now, come on, Bender, something sinister won't build itself. Professor Katz' last name is Katz. Do you think he has something The conclusion is as inescapable as it is moronic. and if he won't talk to us, he'll talk to Smith & Wesson. or perhaps Consolidated Head Melter. Professor Katz, we want answers. I warn you, it's gonna get ugly. What are these strings on his lap? He isn't dead. He's one of those dog-operated puppets that's been adapted for use by a cat! So I had my doctorate denied the planetary ratchet from my thesis! Well, look what the me dragged in.",
"You can talk! You can talk? How ironic! Two hyper-intelligent beings both pretending to be Say, do you know Obliteron? He pretends to be a hamster, but. Yeah, that's really great. what's going on?! What? Oh, right. and I are from the ninth planet of the star you call Thuban. Long ago, life there was ideal. The sun provided plenty of warm, dozy light. The Chicken-Salmon roamed free. Yet disaster loomed. Our planet's rotation was gradually slowing. At first, it seemed beneficial.",
"Long dark nights for sleeping, long sunny days for sleeping. But then, it got too hot. And too cold. Our top scientists went to work. At last, they located a planet with the necessary orientation and magnetic field to harness its rotational energy. Earth! Indubitably. Blue-Blue Shiny Ball. In the area now known as Egypt, my people constructed a giant, semi-octahedral antenna to beam Earth's rotational energy to Thuban. The Great Pyramid at Giza! The Egyptians viewed us but ironically, that was our downfall.",
"They pampered us with feasts most fancy and vittles most tender. We grew fat and domesticated. Thounds of years passed, and our home world was nearing total destruction. But the technology to save our planet was lost. until I heard you speak at Mars University. a fat sack of barf, and then you stole it? He intends to siphon off Earth's rotational energy! Earth will come to a stop, and. and half of you will freeze. Earth will be one big McDLT. We just got that commercial last year.",
"Oh, yeah, smarty paws? You may have built the ratchet, but you can't reach the core of superconducting wire. The ball of yarn! Even so, you'd still need a tremendously powerful static charge to trigger the process. Ever had a cat rub up against you? If you're propositioning me, I'm not interested. I'm talking about the charge generated when 50,000 felines rub against a single surface. Professor? Soon the world will and there's nothing you can do to stop it.",
"The stopping of the world, that is. It's unstoppable. The Earth h h is coming to a st! Keep your eyes on the kitties and push! to be employing some form of hypnotic hyper-cuteness. Well, two can play at that game. And one of them is me. Nibbler? Poopsie-doodle? Mr. Winkles, Quick, dance with each other! Damn, they are good. We're coming to a full stop.",
"All cats, to your posts! Catastrophe Beach Party. Scene One. Cue disaster effects and. action! That extra looked at the camera. We'll have to do it again. And now to transfer your planet's rotational energy to my home world. Well, now, this calls for a celebration. What's all this cat hair on my sweater? Why am I full of sand? And Tootsie Rolls? You were all under the spell of those obnoxious space cats! Enjoy being broiled alive by the sun, and also the dead bird we've left in your slipper.",
"Quickly! If we turn the ratchet the other way, perhaps we can restart the Earth! It won't turn. Push harder, Bender! I can't! my cousin, Turner. Even in theory, the device can only apply force in one direction. Can someone open a window? It's getting a little warm in here. Is that better? to invent that awful device? Amy, technology isn't intrinsically good or evil. Like the death ray. Maybe you're right. I guess science has to keep pushing forward Pushing forward! Professor, I know how to restart the Earth! You can't suddenly know something just by assembling a committee of words.",
"I'll assemble your committee! The ratchet won't turn backwards, we kept pushing it forward? Earth would start turning again! Yes. the wrong direction! Gentlemen, ladies, let's get this globe trotting. It's working! Just a little faster! But we're plotzing here! Then look at Nibbler! On the whole, Earth society is worthless. But they do have these things called antique rugs that are great for peeing on.",
"And though the world is now spinning in the wrong direction, it's good enough. Well done, Amy. I'm honored to begrudgingly present with your Ph. D. In applied physics. Also, some kind of sportsmanship award I had in my glove compartment. Yay! I'm finally done How's the job market? Congratulations, Dr. Wong! Congratulations. Permission to come aboard? Granted, shnookums.Item oneduck! Cubert, you crapscallion! Why aren't you in school? I couldn't get past the protestors.",
"A bunch of smiling, angry people were handing out these anti-evolution flyers. Evolution is under attack in our schools?! To the Science Mobile. You mean the ship? The Science Mobile. It's just that you've never called it that before, but okay. I don't understand evolution, and I have to protect my kids from understanding it! We will not give in to the thinkers! You people are as loud as you are ignorant. Now get back on your turnip trucks and go home! That is an insultingly accurate stereotype, sir! As a Professor of science, I assure you that we did, in fact, evolve from filthy monkey-men! I cannot speak for you, sir, but my ancestors were not monkeys.",
"They were orangutans. Hard-working, patriotic orangutans. Dr. Banjo? In the fur. And I remind you that evolution is merely a theory, like gravity, or the shape of the Earth. Hey, Professor, I'm a flying spaghetti monster. You seriously believe I'm descended from some kind of flightless manicotti? A far more logical explanation is the undisprovable science of Creatureism. All life was created in its present form by a fantastical creature from outer space! Bunk! If your elitist East Coast evolution is real, why has no one found the missing link between modern humans and ancient apes? We did find it.",
"It's called Homo erectus. Then you have proven my case, sir, for no one has found the link between apes and this Homo erectus. Aha! But no one has found the missing link between ape and this so-called Australopithecus africanus! Oh-ho! I've got you now. Fair enough, but where then is the missing link between apes and this Darwinius masillae? Answer me that, Professor! Okay, granted, that one missing link is still missing, we haven't found it doesn't mean it doesn't exist! Things don't exist simply because you believe in them.",
"Creature in the Sky! banana-swilling poop-slinger! We just need to find that last missing link. I found a missing link. man, half toucan. Not what we're looking for. Throw it in the soup! And here's something. Uh-oh. It's another one of Fry's dogs. You find something, Hermes? Uh. no. Ugh! I hate chiseling right after a manicure. Oh, darn it! I broke off one of my of fingers! Look, Cubert. The neck on this one. I bet he spent a fortune on ties! What, too soon? a Jurassic elaphrosaurid had access to neckwear.",
"I knew I should have gone with the ring-around-the-collar joke. I found a robot fossil! That's a bedspring, you dumb bedspring! There are no robot fossils. Who says I didn't evolve? Everybody! Robots were created quite recently. It was in all the papers. Then explain this! I've hit a rich vein of missing links. Java Man, Piltdown Man, Manfred Mann. Eureka! missing missing link. This will show Banjo once and for all. Oh, that's mine. Hmm! My tux doesn't fit. Probably because I've grown so much since I last wore it.",
"Or evolved, one might say. One might not say that. Your tux doesn't fit because you stole it from a boy. You mean a man. It was his Bar Mitzvah. Welcome, museum members. Or as I like to call you, future exhibits. Tonight, we have a new resident here in the e e Hall of Homini, generously donated by its discoverer, Hubert Farnsworth. Ladies and gentlemen. Homo Farnsworth! Once again, science saves the day. The end. And now, to discuss the scientific implications of this discovery, our new museum curator, Dr.",
"Banjo! Thank you, Professor Farnsworth, for your generous gift, which has once and for all disproven evolution. Behold! Homo Farnsworth frolicking with dinosaurs at the moment of creation. I don't want to live on this planet anymore. Faster! Faster! Just drop me off at that asteroid over there. Wow, this planetoid is Not lifeless enough! so I can kick you out of it! Professor, is this your only water source? Diet Dr. Pepper. It's not that bad. It's just laden with toxic minerals. But not for long.",
"What's in the tube? Microscopic nanobots. They're tiny robots I designed to eat up nasty irritants. Speaking of nasty irritants, what's gonna become of Cubert? Who? Oh, my son. Don't worry. He's been safely abandoned with his godfather. Cubert, I felt we needed some father-son bonding time, so I found a couple and boiled them up for lunch. Why don't you just go to hell?! What are they?! Okay, I finished moving the last grand piano. Now can we have our pizza? You'll get your damn pizza, you parasite.",
"First let's see if my nanobots have purified the water yet. Ah, the water's as sterile as my milkman-trusting father. The nanobots have gotten more complex. Those robots evolved It wasn't by themselves. I put them there. I'm a genius. Get over it. Now they got bigger. Good heavens. Trilobots. Oh, no! My sunglasses were in there! out of here! Look, there's a cave-like hole in that mountain. Does anyone have a lighter? Hang on. Okay, we have shelter and just enough precious food to ward off starvation.",
"Pineapple?! Oh, man! for that. I remembered you liked superheroes, so I painted you a mural on your wall. This is Father-Man. He fights crime to earn Son-Boy's respect. Is it working? to do three-point perspective? I could make a better mural Father-Man away. Nothing like a cave for a good night's sleep. not poisoned with pineapple? I packed plenty of food, but it's all in dehydrated pill form. Then we need water from that pond. We'll have to fight our way past the trilobots. Hit anything that moves! A whole forest grew overnight.",
"All these trees are robotic. I can't believe how quickly they sprung up. I can. Robots do everything faster, including evolving and believing how quickly things spring up. One thing about Bristol-Myers-Squibb. they know how to cook a steak. I'm the Tidy Bowl Man. I own a yacht, and everybody poops on me! Everybody grab a club. big, tough water guy, why don't you come up here on land and. ? Look out for the next thing! Great Scott, a tricycle-tops. Throw down, dinosaurs of the land and sea.",
"Dr. Zoidberg? I'm sorry for treating you like a total Zoidberg. I mean, loser. Go on. I guess I kind of make fun of people as a defense mechanism. Hey, Cubert, is that your family mansion? Why don't you ask your mom? She's coming over for a sex visit. Don't worry, I know how to handle bullies. Just pretend like you're pathetic. Help, I'm scared! I'm crying like a baby and I'm soaking in pee, but what else is new? I'm off to pottery class, dorkwads. And that's that. Whoa! You're like some kind of Dumpster Jedi.",
"So. you want to come in maybe? I've got a nice pound cake with a footprint on it. Aah, don't eat my butt! If this is anything like killing that pigeon on my balcony, we've got our work cut out for us. Look out, a solar flare! What the shmell happened? A mass extinction. That solar flare created a huge electromagnetic pulse that, while harmless to organic life, short-circuited the robo-dinosaurs. Convenient. Only puny mammal-like robots cowering in caves could survive such a catastrophe.",
"I taught myself to knit. Wait a moment. If we could scavenge the right parts from these robo-dinos, I might be able to construct a rudimentary spaceship to get us off this planet. hours, but it's finished. It's solar powered, so we can't take off until sunrise. Well, let's find something comfy to bed down on. Hey, looky here. Sweet robot swan of Botswana. a little surviving last night, huh? Whatever. Hey, looky there. Those robo-cavemen have kidnapped our human regular-women. But the only weapon we have is my fan dance.",
"Hmm. I believe I can fashion a slingshot using this robot wishbone and this elastic from my pants. I think they want wives, so just play along. If it doesn't work out, we'll still get half their rocks. I can earn my own rocks. Also, I don't want any rocks. Well, it took almost 12 hours, but it's finished. It's too dark now, but first thing tomorrow, we'll slingshot them like they've never been slangshat. What's going on? It was the weirdest thing. We went to sleep, and when we woke up, our cave husbands were gone.",
"I'm going to miss Spencer. Don't be afraid, little guys. I'm not going to hurt you. Nice net. you can speak? Dread my locks. robot human. I'm Dr. Widnar, a naturalist. And I'm Bender, baby. My human slaves and I come from a planet where organic life and robotic life Amazing. I've theorized that carbon-based, but until today, I never had any proof. Good for you. Can we go home now? Welcome, museum members, or as I like to call you, future exhibits. I now present my latest discovery.",
"You're under arrest for crimes against science. Could you drag me by the restroom? Order! In the matter of Everyone v. Farnsworth, the alleged creationist faces a sentence of death by melting. Who is representing the accused? I am, Your Honor. Bender, what the hell are you doing? Shut up, I'm billing you by the hour. Besides, I'm a robot; They'll listen to me. Ladytrons and gentlebots. Objection. In the absence of pants, defense's suspenders serve no purpose. I'm going to allow them.",
"The prosecution rests, Your Honor. Very well. We will reconvene when the jury reaches a verdict. Son, you in a whole mess o' trouble. Has the jury reached a verdict? No, we have not, for we have evolved to a higher state of consciousness. In the grand scheme, all physical beings are but yokels. Now, settle your and get the hell out. photographs don't lie. I admit that what you witnessed may have been some form of evolution. I'm glad you agree, Dr. Banjo. Evolution set in motion by a wise and all-knowing creator.",
"Oh, well, I don't know about all-knowing. And I admit it's possible, however unlikely, that some wise and all-knowing alien monster set evolution in motion here on Earth. Oh, oh! And the creator could also be a robot. Then who built this so-called creator robot? Some magical bearded robot in the sky? Never mind. Then it's settled. Finally, a world in which I'm happy to raise my son. I'm serious. He's a terrible person.",
"I'll need accomplices. A sexy vamp to distract and tie up the guard. Never. A claw man to slip past the metal scanner And cut the alarm wires. Sorry, I'm set for life after that last job. And finally, a chump To be caught on video and later arrested. As I told you on sucker-punch day, I'm through being a chump. Of course, it would all require split-second, robotic timing. That's where I come in. You see, I own a watch. There. This time I'm sure I've fixed the mind-switcher.",
"Good, I'm sick of cleaning up those heaps of dead monkeys. But why would you want your mind in a new body? Well, as a man enters He thinks back on the mistakes he's made in life. Like the heaps of dead monkeys? Science cannot move forward No, what I regret is the youth I wasted playing it safe. I wasted my youth porking out. Yes, I remember. Would you please take that down? It's making me hungry. Funny, I could use a little extra meat on my bones. Wait a second. I could live life to the extreme And you could indulge your demonic food lust.",
"This mind-switcher was made for by us. Wait, can I still change my mind? Let's find out. It didn't work, you doddering old. Ah, cartilage. a fond cowabunga. I'm off to laugh at the reaper. Look out, world, here I. I'm sorry, Amy, but your body's not up to the task. Also, I don't care for these boobs Flapping every which way. your bologna-gargling And let's switch back into our original bodies. Body-switching, eh? Mayhap the heist is back on. Who needs accomplices if I can just use their bodies? Professor, what's not happening? Bad news, me.",
"I failed to take into account the cerebral immune response. Once two bodies have switched minds, They can never switch back. However, perhaps they can. Maybe we can swap back using a third body For temporary storage space. I'm 60 % storage space. the royal yacht For a quick seduce-and-snatch. Now then, Amy, we'll And then we'll, we'll. In my body, but then you and bender would be switched, And the Amy and bender bodies can't trade minds again, Since they just did. Oh, no. everyone back to normal Using four or more bodies? I'm not sure.",
"I'm afraid we need Stupid air-needing lungs. the crown jewels. To locate the guard and seduce him in. Four seconds?! Who goes there? Three, two, one. Silence.

All I wanted was to gorge myself a little, But I can't digest anything And this hit-or-miss colon. a senior discount at the movies. I hate paying $14 to see Nicolas cage solve things. If you want to save two dollars, We can always switch back, right? Mmm, what smells saturated? Deep-fried ice cream sandwich Wrapped in frosting and lightly baconed.",
"Whoa, that sounds like something Amy would say and eat. Leela and I used the Professor's mind-switching machine. So Leela's in your body? see, you do only like me for my body. That is entirely not true, sir. with zoidberg, Sneak past the metal detector, and clip the alarm wires, All in less than. Ten minutes ago?! when my chump gets here? Now then, What is a filthy human doing aboard my royal yacht? With all due respect, your majesty, I'm a robot like you. Go ahead, ask me something only a robot would know.",

"You aren't, are you? Of course not, But I was willing What more can a man do? A man can give her a toke of her own medicine. Yes, I could put my mind into a hideous body And show Leela she's not attracted to me, really, really disgusting body. Friends, friends, I've got barnacles on my tuchus. The long search is over. Wait here and earn interest while I find my robot body. Professor? Bender. Have you seen my body? I think the Professor's in it. Yeah, he said something about running away.",
"Then he ran away. Whither?! What am I going to do? I got an emperor all But only with another robot. Scruffy's work here is done. Now to find emperor Von Richendoof. Now to find scruffy. I don't see why not. I also don't see why. In your face, Leela. If you're a bender, why is your body full of fetid water? If you're an emperor, why don't you shut up?! Move it, fry! Oh!

"And where do these proud toileteers learn their menial skills? At brown university, the nation's premiere institution of lower learning. So please, give generously, knowing some poor helpless mutant will thank you. Not in person, thank God. Well, that was disturbing. Oh, I understand, dear. They are hideous. Look, I guess you mean well, but isn't that university sewer-cleaning service? My dear, that school is about much more than sewer pipes. It's also about keeping those filthy things busy.",
"There are thousands of them down there, breeding like rats. My great uncle once saw a rat. If we don't keep them busy, they'll start jabbering about equal rights in their ill-bred manner. If I say one more thing, with my evening boot. Well! Rarely have I never! Please, don't blame Leela. uh, ill-bred. You know how mutants are. Your companion is a mutant? But if anyone asks, say she's an alien. the authorities, but don't nothing get past Mrs. Astor. What's going to happen to me?! Permanent deportation, you mutant.",
"You going downtown, baby. Way down. Incoming! Thanks, colonel. Just doing my job, ma'am. Oh, mom, dad, I can't believe I have to spend the rest of my life in this hellhole. I'm sorry. Now that you're here, this hellhole feels more like a nice, regular hole. we go get some sewer coffee, sewer cake and safeway ice cream. Who's in the mood to party? Poor Leela. I feel like I ruined her life. You did ruin her life. You might be right, Hermes. I am right. do something to help her. We should do something! I don't care what you say, Hermes.",
"Oh, mighty Mayor, we're here about Turanga Leela. You mean Leela? I mean, sure she's a mutant, we've known that for years, but we kept it secret'cause she's a fine, upstanding. Wait. You knowingly attempted to harbor a mutant?! We did harbor a mutant! there's old filthful. And there's for even a second, This is my daughter Leela. How you doing, Leela? Well, they're with the chuds now. These conditions are deplorable. I swear, I hate every single person on the surface for making us live like this.",
"What are you doing here? We were sentenced to two weeks in the sewer for harboring a mutant. Three dollars at the drug store. I'm so sorry I ratted you out, but, you know, after two weeks down here, I'll truly understand the plight of the mutant people. How dare you. You want to understand something? One dip in that toxic muck and your DNA will be permanently mutated. You'll grow a camel hump or a Zoidberg face. You want to know what it's like to be a mutant? Jump in and go for a swim. a bunch of potato salad, so.",
"You are all surface. Fry, Hermes. Where my humans at? Ah, who cares? It is on. I trust the orgy pit has been scraped and buttered? You know it, and there's mini-quiches, too. It's getting cold and smelly. My odor eaters are going critical. in that giant cockle. Shmeepers, it's the land Titanic, the biggest and onlyest land boat ever constructed. This was one hell of a bus. Well, everyone debone a bunk and get some shut-eye. Zoidberg, show some respect. This is a sacred shrine to the thousands who lost their lives.",
"Hey, I found a safe. It's coming loose. Hand me some more of that cruise director. The original passenger manifest. Spreadsheets were so elegant back then. Just one other item. It's jewelry. jewelry. It's jewelry, people! It's a priceless quantum-force gemerald. What's that enscribbled on it? My dear Mrs. Astor. My love for you is as unsinkable as this land ship and as brilliant as this stone. Dictated but not read, Mr. Astor. I'll never have love like that. Leela hates me now.",
"Did you guys know I have a crush on Leela? What's the matter, Leela? You've hardly touched your toilet clams. Maybe I was too harsh on Fry. He didn't ruin my life on purpose. Things will work out, honey. Now, here. Have some more of what looks like lemonade. Bender, I've been to wang-dang-doodles all up and down the galaxy, but this is the dangest wang I ever doodled. Come on, baby, let's do it! Shake your booty, baby. Come on! Yeah! It's not fun anymore! I want to be alone! Alone with me? I said scram, Grapey! Fry? What are you doing?! You were right.",
"I don't know what it's like to be a mutant. But I want to know. Wait. I never meant for you to. Oh, no! Fry! Fry! Any effect? Sorry. I tried to scream, but I barfed. I think I'm knowing what it's like to be a mutant. all the screaming? Fry, this is the stupidest, sweetest thing you've ever done. And you know, maybe now, together, we can be an inspiration to other mutants. Aw. Come here. Handshake. My fellow mutants, until recently, I dwelt on the surface, where a man can gaze up at the sky in wonder falling in his mouth.",
"We can do that, too. Who's ready to fight for equality? The devolution revolution has begun! Beautiful mutants, Hello, sewer city. As longtime mutants ourselves, we support your righteous struggle, and we'll do anything we can for you! No. Play the other one. their attention, where they sit by bending the West Side pipeway to return all sewage to the surface. bend such a huge pipe? So lonely. Poor, sad Bender. Bend it! Bend it! Bend it! Bend it! What goes down must back up. I picked the wrong day to wear my new crocses.",
"Prepare to storm the surface for the million mutant march! Move out, Fry. We need our most disgusting mutant leading the charge. I'll meet you up there. I need to check out something first. you're up front. Mayor, this sewer debacle has gone on long enough. As your largest campaign contributor, I demand action! Very well. $80 worth of action it is. We simply pump the fruits of our excretion into Madison cube garden. Well, it seems everything is under. Four! The mutant people will arise! The segregation of the mutant people ends today.",
"We demand equal rights, equal access to the surface and the blood of your first-born children. so we have something to give up in the negotiations. I've never been so moved, and I see no reason to begin now. Hobbsy, flush those creatures back down the hole they crawled out of. Madam's sewage-seeking Mrs. Astor, deep in the sewer, we discovered the wreck of the land Titanic, on which your husband land-drowned. Inside was something that might interest you. The gemerald ring my husband was to give me in lieu of children.",
"I have a chandelier in my car made of those. This passenger manifest. It turns out there were mutants on that ship working below deck in the sewage galley. I was just a young girl. Drain angels, they called us. When the ship started going down, my mother grabbed me and made for the nearest life car. But the places were all taken by surface passengers. As my mother held me tight, i suddenly felt the gentle tap of a cane on my face. I turned to see the kindly smile of Mr. Astor. Thanks to your husband's humanity, I lived to raise my own daughter, and she a daughter in turn.",
"This isn't a lousy reformed Robanukah! We need more petroleum oil! some squirrel oil. Not kosher! It has to be petroleum oil! Do you not give a damn traditions of Robanukah?! I reckon I do not. Anyways, Earth done run out of petroleum oil. I tried to warn you. One unit of free, limitless solar power, please? I don't know, ten bucks? Um, can you make change for a Nobel prize? Aw, man, can't we just make more petroleum oil? I'm afraid not, son. Petroleum only forms when organic matter is subjected to intense pressure for hundreds of millions of years.",
"I can't wait that long! This is so unfair! I don't wrestle dry, Bender. I went to Vassar. Professor, I want you to look these poor floozies in the eye and tell them they're oil-wrestling days are over. Oh. I suppose there could be a minute quantity of petroleum left, but it would be insanely deep within the Earth, at pressures so dangerously high that. Let's go already! Setting bachman turners to overdrive. We're getting pretty deep. Look. more coffins. Oh, no! We tunneled into a tunnel.",
"What's that loud boring sound you'll hear when I stop talking? It's an albino humping worm! Because it doesn't have any pigment. What's our depth, Captain? There must be petroleum oil down here somewhere. Go deeper, deeper! No, Bender. The ship can't withstand this much pressure. Sometimes it falls apart just sitting in the hangar. Professor, I've never asked for anything before. But seeing those fembots glistening with oil means more to me than life itself. Call me an old fool, but I believe the Lord is speaking through you.",
"Brace yourselves, everyone! Two hundred! I hate to complain but the air conditioner's on fire. My ice cream manwich! What the hell are we doing? We're all gonna die so this junkyard golem can celebrate Robanukah! You vile racist. Haven't my people suffered enough? Now keep drilling for that petroleum oil, you selfish cowards! Although, then again, I guess any kind ? I am so great Bender is great Bender, Bender, Bender, Ben. ? Man, where did the time go? Hey, you guys wanna…",
"Oh, right. They turned into petroleum oil. I thought they were selfish, yet in the end, it turns out it was I who thought they were selfish. I found some. There was only enough petroleum for four and a half weeks of oil wrestling, but it lasted 500 million years! It's a miracle! Happy Robanukah, everyone. Coming up next, more thoughtful interfaith hilarity. And now the unrelated conclusion. Labarbara, Hermes, happy Kwanzaa! We brought a chocolate cake, but now I'm worried that might be offensive in some way.",
"Just sit down. Happy Kwanzaa, brothermen and sistermen! the cat dragged in! Kwanzaa tradition encourages educational gifts. So I brought Dwight my book on mathketball. I'll sign it for you later. Man, it's a cold one out there. Barbados slim? Come in, Barbados. Look at yourself, all throbbing and shirtless for the holiday. I hope you're ready to celebrate. All night long, woman. be here with my family. Kwanzaa traditions are quite ancient, dating back over one thousand years. If only someone could tell us more about these traditions.",
"Hey, Kool-aid's here. No, child, that's not a made-up character, it's Kwanzaabot! And I'm-a tell y'all how we celebrate Kwanzaa. Zoidberg, lay down a beat. How'bout I just lay down There's seven basic principles that go to make up Kwanzaa so sit your asses down and have some knowledge dropped upons ya. and umoja and the rest Sit back down, there's gonna be a test. My favorite's ujamaa ? Cooperative economics. ? Yo, boondocks, I'm talkin' here Ku'umba is another one it stands for creativity ? ever-changing nature of my sexual proclivities.",
"I think there's one called nia but I don't speak Swahili. something about a pine tree and an oil-wrestling dealie That's from Xmas and Robanukah you plagiarizing lout. ? Yeah, I'm kinda losing interest here I best be rollin' out. But before I go, the most important thing ? What's that, black Santa You need seven Kwanzaa candles that you light up every night or y'all might as well be white ? or we might as well be white. no beeswax candles, but these scented regular wax candles will do just fine.",
"Girl, those stank sticks are for single women who take baths! If your Kwanzaa candles ain't 100 % beeswax, you bring shame on your people. Well, now that won't do. Husband, show a little ku'umba and fetch some beeswax before Kwanzaa ends. Sweet candelabra of la habra, labarbara! Isn't this the last night of Kwanzaa? Who the hell knows? Finally, a bee farm that's open late on Kwanzaa! Madam, I need beeswax. You sure you don't need a little honey, handsome? Maybe a taste of sweet nectar straight from the hive? I just need some beeswax to make Kwanzaa candles.",
"Well, that's too darn bad. There ain't no beeswax in the whole world! Oh, no! This could be the year without a Kwanzaa, like every year before 1966. The bees are acting all crazy, like they've been drinking tang and cough syrup, or, as I call it, my Friday night. It's colony collapse syndrome! The bees are swarming with parasites! They're all dying. Die young, leave a pretty corpse, You should say something else. Wait. I know where we can get beeswax. From those giant space bees who nearly killed us, and we swore we'd never go back there! Let's go back there! To communicate with the bees, we'll need to use these transbumbleators.",
"Bender, say something in bee talk. I'm sorry, Bender. What do you want me to put on the glass? If we survive. Something's wrong. Like the deadly prius. Ah, here they come. They're in attack formation! They're going to kill us! That was weird. It's like the Jagermeister air show all over again. According to Google hive, we're at the exact center of the honeycomb. Ooh, and there's a jamba juice point two miles that way! Does that thing tell you where the queen bee is? compound-eyed, hairy-thorax.",
"Don't be applying your euro-centric standards Man, my hive's been going buck wild since these blood ganking butt crabs moved in. Been there. Done that. These bees are infected, just like the ones on Earth. Brothasuckin' parasites gone and disrupted our hivemind. Now instead of working in harmony, smack to each other. Are y'all black with yellow stripes, or ya yellow with black stripes? Yellow with black stripes, man. Why don't you just move along? Let me ask you something. You sting my wife? What kinda buzzin' question is that? Where do you get the wings big enough to ask me that? Okay, gang.",
"We have plenty of beeswax. No. We are not going anywhere. I can't abide all this bee-on-bee conflict. It's time to African-americanize these honeybees! Listen up, bees! It's Kwanzaa, a time of umoja. It means unity. You have to learn to work together again! The crazy tablecloth man is right. our differences. Black stripe, yellow stripe. At the end of the day, we're just a couple dern talkin' space bees. Hey, forget about it. Come here and give me a sting. Look! The spirit of Kwanzaa is killing the parasites.",
"Thank you, my human brother. Your message of unity has touched our souls. We are once again of a single hivemind. Hooray! Kwanzaabot's here to save. Joyous Kwanzaa, everybody. Don't worry. The Futurama crew will be back next year with all new episodes featuring Bender, Leela, and me, Al Gore, as Captain Lance Starman. And from all of us here at Gunderson's nuts, Tip for downloadOpen Subtitles MKV Player Previously on Futurama. It has now been one month since space ripped open like flimsy human skin.",
"Terrified earthlings are beginning to grow exhausted. Professor, sprinkle us with wisdom from your mighty brain. How scared should we be? Somewhere between not at all and entirely. I call entirely. Scientists believe the rip is a gateway to another universe, but do not know what mysteries lie beyond. However, in this reporter's opinion gruesome death awaits us all! And now with sports, here's Sportsbot 5000. All sports canceled. To better understand the anomaly, I will now focus its radiation on a giant medium-sized ant to see what happens.",
"What's going on here? I was told there would be sugar syrup. Oh, hey, everyone, this is Colleen. I like your shoes. This is awkward. Introducing your new girlfriend to Chesty McNag-nag. Oh, don't mind him. I'll turn him off. Hey, you can't turn me off. Hi, Leela, hi, everyone. Sorry I've been taking up so much of Fry's time. He's just so interesting. Have you seen how much cotton candy he can eat? Oh, my, yes. 5. 1 pounds. is so good on pancakes. We're taking a cuddle-cab to Hug-a-Bunny Village.",
"This lovey-dovey stuff is making me vomit from my saltwater and freshwater stomachs. It is pretty sickening. No, the double-vomit is a sign of joy. Fry told me how he and Colleen first met. So, how did you and Colleen first meet? Something about seeing it on the Jumbotron makes it so much more real. It's so scary. What are you supposed to do when the whole universe is coming to an end? This is gonna be juicy. What? Oh, man! Speaking of sappy love. Want to tell them, Kiffy? Yes, Amy and I have a big announcement.",
"Kif has asked me to be his Fonfon Ru. Wonderful! What the hell does that mean? It means I've asked Amy to join my family. And you're all invited to my family swamp for our Fonfon Rubok ceremony. If I had ever heard of it, it would have been what I had always dreamed of. And our parents will be meeting for the first time ever. That's even more awkward than Fry's two bimbos meeting each other. Count me in. Mr. And Mrs. Wong, aren't you excited that we're all about to be joined in a single family? You can't borrow money.",
"Kif's parents come late and we have to stand around in swamp getting eaten alive by damn bugs? Mrs. Wong, no. The final stage of my species' life cycle is a colony of flying hookworms. You just squashed part of my father. Sorry. I guess you got plenty of bugs to spare though, huh? And the awkward meter goes up another notch. Wow, Colleen, you look so beautiful in the light of the swamp gas. Thanks. This is really fun. I love going to exotic worlds and getting hammered. Two more Harvey Wallclimbers.",
"Leela, I can't help but notice you're unescorted. Might I escort you behind that bush for the next five minutes? Nothing would revolt me more. Then how about that shrub? Ooh! Rubok is begun. I am the grand priestess. Aren't you also the grand midwife? And the grand lunch lady. I work five jobs, all grand. Kif of the clan Kroker, please trescend the Rubok Etlon with your Fonfon Smizmar Ru. Get in the mud. This mud is the petroleum from a billion generations of Kif's ancestors. As you become one with the ooze, so you become one with the clan Kroker.",
"Calculon residence. Oh, hello, Mr. Calculon. Son of a bit. This is my house. But that means I'm blackmailing myself. Why didn't you tell me, Monique? I tried to, but I couldn't. Oh, Calculon, I'm afraid you have a fourth personality the other three don't know about, and it and I are lovers! How's Calculon going to take this, Fry, especially after that humiliating tennis tournament? Fry? Don't know, Bender. Tonight's my big date with Colleen. I got to run. But me and you like to watch together.",
"Look, I got you a cabbage to snack on. Humans like cabbage, right? Step right up to the 2D Tunnel of Love. Not one, not three, but two glorious dimensions for the price of a single ticket. Keep your hands in the car, shut up, and have fun. Wow, you even look beautiful in 2D. But from your perspective, I'm just a line segment. FRY. A really hot line segment. So, listen, sweetie pie, I was thinking maybe we should take this to the next step. Yes. Colleen… will you be moved in with by me? Hooray, hooray.",
"That's great. You're moving in with her? Why can't she move in with us? I could just curl up at the foot of the bed. Listen up, everyone. I know you've all been extremely worried about the cosmic anomaly. The what? Oh, right. But there's good news. We're all going to learn more about it at a scientific conference. MAN. Like a city made of marshmallow. of Stephen Hawking on a way-cool rocket. Black hole Hawking? Wow, if I knew I was going to meet you, I would have done something with my hair.",
"In conclusion, I understand nothing about the anomaly, even after cashing the huge check I got for writing a book about it. I know this anomaly is terrifying. But as scientists, is it not our sworn duty to seek out knowledge, even at the cost of our very lives? I say we must mount an expedition to the anomaly forthwith. I agree. Wernstrom! Professor Farnsworth is correct. Only a manned mission can. Don't listen to that crackpot! But I'm agreeing with you. I'll make you eat those words, you moron! I volunteer to lead the expedition.",
"I have a squad of graduate students eager to risk their lives for a letter of recommendation. Your squad sucks bosons! and three times as expendable. Oh, tough talk for someone with only one Fields Medal. Wernstrom, I ought to. I didn't know I could do that. Now quiet down and settle this like men of science. Very well. FARNSWORTH. Let Deathball begin! Go, Planet Express! Go even more, my team! Leela, header! Hooray! We're equally good! Come on, Bender! Your grandmother could push harder than that! No crap.",
"My grandmother was a bulldozer. And thus metal man defeated meat man. The end. Come here, winner! Come here, loser! Colleen, what are you doing? My face is over here. This is my boyfriend, silly! I thought I was your boyfriend. You are. Well, how can you have two boyfriends? Oh, I don't. I have five. Fry, meet Chu, Bolt, Ndulu, and Shlomo. Greetings. Pleasure. Shlomo and Ndulu will help you move your stuff into my apartment tonight. Welcome to the relationship, buddy! There's my butterscotch.",
"Congratulations, deathballers! We've won the right to explore the anomaly! I was playing for my freedom! Now, I've often said good newswhen sending you on a mission of extreme danger. So when I say this anomaly is dangerous, you can imagine how dangerous I really think it is. Not dangerous at all? Actually, quite dangerous indeed. That is quite dangerous! Indeed. Now stop shilly-shallying! Prep the ship and line up for your preflight coffee enemas! Warning. The enema you are about to enjoy is extremely hot.",
"I don't know what to do, Leela. Should I move in with Colleen and her four other boyfriends? What are you going to do? Sleep in a big pile like hamsters? No! It's not like that. Everyone gets his own room and a shelf in the refrigerator. Take the deal, Fry! If there's a delicious cake, isn't it better to have one slice than none at all? Even if four other guys eat the other four slices, and they're all thrusting their sweaty naked bodies against the cake? Only one thing matters, Fry. Do you really love Colleen, Yeah.",
"I do love her. Then things will work out. Double espresso for Philip Fry? Sorry, I'm not going on the mission. I'm moving in with Colleen! Good for you, Fry. Oh, Fry! Welcome to your new home! Thanks, Colleen. And listen, I'm sorry I got jealous before. I'm just happy to be here with you. Want a slice of delicious cake? BENDER. The anomaly! It's so anomalous. I'm feeling dread deep in my dreads! Wernstrom! Yes, and I'm afraid I have disturbing news about the anomaly. How did you get this number? Hermes, hang up on him in the rudest possible manner.",
"Yes, sir! No, not the crack slam! Oh, my life rocks. I've got good wine, five sweethearts, and today, I was promoted to Chief of Police. Here's to you. No, Colleen. I'm making a romantic toast. Sorry. I think I. Thank you. I'm not talking to you! Then I am not talking to you, either. Will everyone be quiet a little? I want to hear what he has to say! Thank you. Not you, you Verstinkener. You're just here'cause she likes cave men from the stupid ages. Oh, look who's talking. You're just here'cause she got matzoh fever.",
"So, what's the explanation for you, moron fever? Enough! All of you! Most people in this world don't have what we have. Let's just be grateful, okay? Yeah, you're right. So, Colleen, you look really nice. Oh, thanks. I got dressed up for my date. There he is. Don't wait up! I was okay with this, but I'm not. I'm breaking up with you! Why are we risking our lives? Can't we just send in a robotic drone? What's everybody looking at me for? Let's send a robot to explore it.'Cause you can always buy another one for 20 bucks.",
"I better check my black box. BENDER. The light! It's blinding! And the ass pain! It's searing! So that's what happened. Hey, Bender! Look who's here to cheer you up. I don't need cheering up. I'm perfectly. Greetings, sick fan. TV's Calculon! You poor, mangled husk of what was once a robot! What right hath fate to pluck a sweet, dimple-cheeked mechanism in the flower of his youth? And. Scene! There, that was some free acting for you. Ordinarily, to see acting like that, through a tampon commercial.",
"That fulfills my community service, right? Charges of running me over are hereby dismissed! Where did we go wrong, Fry? We were meant to be together! Nu, I'm freezing my tokhes off here. Just a sec, honey! You look wonderful, robot! I wish I could afford to go to a hospital. I'm dreadfully sick. I feel great, and I owe it all to Calculon. His visit really inspired me. I finally know what I want to be when I grow up. You want to costar in his TV show? Like that time you already did that? No.",
"I'm gonna be a stalker! That's not really a career. More of a felony. Man, I'm gonna stalk his brains out. Ooh! Big news on the Calculon fansite! There's a flash mob headed for his plastic surgeon's office! There, that's as big as I can make it. But I caution you, it looks completely unrealistic. You let me worry about that! Just do your job. Very well. Will you be using your SAG insurance? No, cash. I'd like to be discreet. Dear God, no! Oh boy, oh boy, he's here. Calculon, I love you! Have my baby! CALCULON.",
"Back, you lunatic! Sign my ass! FARNSWORTH. Emergency! Emergency! Everyone to the calamitorium! Can I wipe it off first? No time, woman! No time! Hmm. Smells like angel dust. That's a discontinuous electromagnetic field. Wernstrom tried to warn me, but I was too damn stubborn! Hermes, get Wernstrom on the line so I can apologize. Ogden Wernstrom speaking. Tell him I'm not here! Professor! Oh, very well. Wernstrom, I've been a vainglorious fool! If you can find it in your heart to forgive me, your tiny little heart, would you consider a scientific collaboration? Sir, I'd be honored.",
"As I attempted to warn you, the laws of electromagnetism change abruptly at the anomaly. Observe. Play time is fun time. My heavens! If only I'd heeded your warning, I'd have known it was impossible to cross the barrier! But note what happens when I instead throw this laboratory koala. FARNSWORTH. It passed through unharmed. So living beings can enter the other universe, but electrical devices can't? Then we must mount a second expedition without delay. Right after we blow up more robots.",
"Agreed. Play time is fun time. Who are you? Bender, your biggest fan. Are you going to murder me? Unlikely. In my mind, we're friends. This diorama proves it, see? Sir, your derangement is impressive. I'm appointing you my official stalker. You shan't be disappointed. Pleasant dreams. Now that I've teamed up with my friend, Dr. Wernstrom, I feel certain we can successfully penetrate the other universe. It's the greatest scientific opportunity since you yourself sent men to the moon in 1969.",
"I always regretted that. Nothing up there but dry rocks and those revolting onion men. You East Coast intellectuals had your chance. Now beat it! From here on in, this is a military matter. People of the universe, Rear Brigadier Zapp Brannigan. Thank you, thank you. Well deserved. Kif, stand in that hole so I look taller. Ever since man first left his cave and met a stranger with a different language and a new way of looking at things, the human race has had a dream. so we don't have to learn his language or his new way of looking at things.",
"Give science a chance! Less invasions, more equations! Damn long-hairs. Knock some sense into them, Chief O'Hallahan. Yes, sir! I can't take it, Leela. I need to go away. Far away, forever. Aw, I know how you feel, Fry. There are times when I also feel like you need to go away. Be careful, my little, teeny, greeny weenie. That's just a fungal infection. Oh, she's talking to you, Kif. Wow, how come humans get to do all the fun stuff? This is exactly the sort of thing that ought to be handled by That's adorable, Bender.",
"Clumsy bludgeoning, please. You have selected clumsy bludgeoning. For an additional $10, would you like your eyes scooped out with a melon-baller? What the heck, I'll treat myself. Enemy in range. Prepare to launch universe-to-universe missile. Preparing to launch U. U. M. Hell of a thing to send a universe to certain doom. Fun, though. Makes a man feel big. Come on, come on, I didn't ask to die of boredom! ELECTRONIC VOICE. You are now dead. Please take your receipt. BENDER. What's.",
"What's happening? Kneel before the candle. Don't hurt me! I'll betray anyone! Bender Bending Rodriguez. And. Almost fooled you there. Fire! I heard you the first time, Francine. Sorry. Kif, climb down there and un-jam it, would you? Be a dear. And stop sighing so much. Tell us, Bender. Are you worthy of membership in the League? Worthier than the average robot. Then prove it. Upon each step is a test. Okay, but if it's culturally biased, I'm suing your ass. Test number one.",
"The test of the beer mug! Quite right, quite so. ALL. Drink the mug! Drink the mug! I accept your challenge. ALL. Hurray! The test of the flagon! ALL. Drink the flagon! Drink the flagon! Are all the tests going to involve drinking? It never occurred to me before, but yes. Just give me one more. Oh, no. The test of the infinitely priceless Presenting our newest member. That's right, baby! And so, to everyone and everything I've ever known, So, how are you, Fry? Pretty good. You? Kif, get over here.",
"You've got to try this! Yes, but according to the Old Farmer's Wikipedia, the amazing thing about Kif's species is that the remains continue suffering for up to six hours after death. That's so interesting! Don't ask where I was last night. For all you know, I was at home, perhaps baking a strudel. What's her problem? Somebody die or something? Kif's dead, Bender. My condolences, Amy. Allow me to present you with the last known photo of Lieutenant Kroker. We so sorry, Mr. And Mrs. Kroker.",
"Terrible shame about Froggy. Thank you for your kind words. Yeah, yeah, real sad. Want some breath spray? Cinnamon flavor, taste like pie. This is from the league of you-don't-need-to-know. I am the grand funeral director! Do you validate parking? It is always a terrible tragedy when a swarm outlives its own bulboid. So it is with great sorrow that I now commit the goo that was once Kif to the petroleum of his ancestors. No, from the bottom! It works better! Just stick a butter knife in it! There, I got most of it.",
"The burial is complete. I will now sing the sacred hymn. It's not part of the ceremony, just a little something that I wrote. It may sound strange, but seeing Kif's mutilated remains poured into the mud made me really sad. Mutilation is never easy. I don't think I'll ever love again. Oh, you don't mean that. Love can surprise you at any time in your life. Surprise! Whoa, it kind of takes your breath away. Look alive, death row. Your saggy asses got a visitor. Regular or conjugal? She looked like a freak to me.",
"The guard operating the x-ray machine came down with a sudden case of broken neck, so I was able to bring you that delicious cake you wanted. I don't understand. Are you winking or blinking? Hang on a second. Yes, I'm here to repair my horse. Is the horse's name Hot Beans? No. I mean, yes. So it seems a human had been rather injured by a knife, and as his. As his blood, you know, I think that's what they call it. Quite correct, sir. Blather on! As it drained away, he said…",
"No doubt he intended to say doctor,but he was unable to complete his thought, you see, being as he had died. So, taking him at his word, we dragged his corpse to the waterfront, whereupon the seagulls fed upon it. Humans are dumb and they die easy! Speaking of humans, have I shown you my new monocle? Cost me a king's ransom. Made from a king, don't you know! Oh, how repulsively decadent! Yes. But more importantly, the smiling faces of my children for the first time since I lost my vision in that horrible banking accident.",
"May I see that for a second? My, but that's interesting! I'm blind! My God, Bender! This is a civilized organization! The rules specifically. May I make a point of order, President Calculon? that no human may set foot in the League of Robots! If he has a human part, he's part human! Oh, my! Then I too have a human part And I plan to enjoy the experience. Bender, you've rigidly applied the law with no regard for its intent. Well done! You'll go far in this organization. Oh, you're just gettin' to know Bender.",
"Curses! If we could only turn up the gain, we might smell clear through to the other universe! But we can't adjust it without a screwdriver. Wait a moment. I think I was just shanked with a screwdriver! A little more. A little less. Heavens to meteoroid! Smell this! Holy mother of invention! We must notify the President at once! But how can we? I wish we weren't in prison! You have one wish left, Professor. I think I got him! for letting your guard. Sometimes. Always. Never! You again? This better be damned important.",
"I got a part in a fancy DVD movie! It's only one line, but I'm gonna ham it up like you wouldn't believe. What crummy sin have I committed to be chastised in such a crazy manner? Call me back on my shell phone! ZAPP. Captain's log, stardate, the year of the tiger. The battle has been bravely fought, and the suffering of our troops beyond measure. But the alien is invulnerable, and our defeat inevitable. even from my remote command post here at the Times Square Applebee's. Waiter! Take this fried mozzarella back to the kitchen and fry it some more.",
"The tentacle's coming towards Earth and there's no stopping it. King Kong's too old to save us this time. We have only one hope, Mr. President. We must encase the entire planet in a protective sphere of my patented, ultra-hard diamondium! Diamondium? I could gum through that with my dentures behind my back. My trademarked diamondillium is twice as hard! Twice as hard as your head! Which makes it still fairly soft! Now look here, you Poindexters. I don't care how you decide. Just decide! Diamondillium it is.",
"So, hey, Calculon, I know I'm the new guy, and, pardon my ignorance, but when do we kill all humans? Never. But what about our motto? Doesn't it mean anything? Oh, Bender, your idealism is heartwarming. hasn't killed a human in over 800 years. And that was a very sick girl scout. Quite sick indeed. Sweet, innocent Bender. WERNSTROM. I declare my impenetrable diamondillium sphere complete! Now look here, Wernstrom. You're making it sound as if the sphere was your idea when we both know.",
"All credit to my colleague, Ogden Wernstrom! It's horrible! I can't make it! Go on without me! I'm trying! Go on without me faster! Sweet squid of Madrid! The tentacle got Fry! Quick, hand me my machete! We can still save his legs! Silence! I have traveled far and seen deep, and I have come to know the purpose of our existence. Finally. Thou shalt love the tentacle! Well, at least we don't have to love one another. A new age has begun. The age of the tentacle! Open your necks and receive the love! Ow, my neck! My neck feels perfectly.",
"Ow, my neck! Someone help me! I'm important! Say, I love the tentacle. I also love the neck-a-majigger! Hooray, Zoidberg escaped! Hooray, Zoidberg loves the tentacle! It got Zoidberg! Oh, I never knew how much I'd miss him until he was gone! Not that much, as it turns out. Thus sayeth the tentacle, Verily, thou shalt rejoice in the house of the tentacle. Fry, listen to yourself. You've been brainwashed. No, I'm just trying to fit my diction to the importance of what I'm saying. I'm listening.",
"Don't be afraid of the tentacle, Leela. It's beautiful and it loves me. And I love it. Aw. That's so nice for both of you. I know it may seem strange that I have feelings for an octopus monster from another universe. And yes, perhaps it's not the storybook romance that's been crammed down our throats by Hollywood. But the Monsterpus has loved us from afar since we were amoebas. Only when the space anomaly opened could it finally express a billion years of longing. Fire diamondium cannon! The crystals are bouncing off the tentacle like meatballs off Mothra.",
"Oh, what a surprise. I told you diamondium was worthless! Wernstrom, quit hyping your cheap diamondillium and look at this. According to this blinking light, the tentacle is made of electro-matter, matter's bad-ass grandma! Nothing from our universe can cut through it. Not diamondium, not diamondillium, not even your wife's pound cake, Hermes! She's a terrible cook. Anyway, we're all dead. So, Bender, is something wrong?'Cause my roommate doesn't notice or even care that I'm upset! What, Bender? Is something wrong? Yes! I joined a club I thought was cool, but it turns out all the leaguie-weegies are totally lame.",
"That's what we call ourselves, I'm sorry. I should've asked what was bothering you. I've been kind of preoccupied. Well, I went to another universe, and I fell in love with a giant octopus, and now I'm pope of a new religion. Weren't you already pope of something? Oh. Well, I'm just saying I'd like you to show an interest in my life, too. Okay, let's catch up soon. But right now, I gotta go shove a tentacle into everyone in China. They're coming! Those horrible, horrible things are coming! Morbo? As the universe falls prey to the revolting alien, only a few isolated pockets of resistance remain.",
"Those pockets sure are missing out on a great thing. Sorry. I thought I saw a tentacle, but it was just a harmless land squid. I better have some cocoffee. When I gave up diapers, my parents promised exactly this would never happen! Nobody panic! Just get to the panic room! Well done, people! We had a great first week. We got 90 % of world leaders, everyone who bought a Hanes undershirt, and this year's most promising new R&B group, for the Grammy-nominated Funkalistics! Talkin''bout the tentacle Good news, everyone! I was up all night inventing, and then finally, I invented! Invented what? The neck protector, the neck protector junior, and now, for a limited time, the lady neck protector! I'll take two.",
"My neck is huge. We're perfectly safe now. Time to stop living like a bunch of nervous nellies. Professor, these look like you cut them from cardboard toilet paper tubes. So? Lots of important inventions are made from toilet paper tubes. Microscopes, the internet, tentacle polish. It got the professor! Wait, why am I screaming? Stop, in the name of love! Crud. two normal people on Earth. At least I won't have to trim my elbow talons anymore. I'm scared! And I miss Kif! It's okay to cry, Amy.",
"Come here, I'm wearing absorbent shoulder straps. What an erotic display of girl-on-girl consolation. Hurry, Leela, we don't have much time to begin repopulating Earth. Go brush your teeth. I'll be waiting for you naked under this quesadilla. Stop resisting, my brethren! Don't you want to be part of something bigger than yourselves? Like a big crazy monster? So we got her, huh? Bring her in! Do it already! Hello, Colleen. Fry, please! If this is about your futon, I sold it to pay the phone bill that you skipped out on! Colleen wasn't satisfied with me.",
"Were you, Colleen? Come on, Fry, this isn't cool! She had to have four other boyfriends! I guess she never thought I'd become tentacle pope of the world! You know what? It's true! You weren't enough for me! No one man is! You were great, but you weren't Chinese, you weren't Cameroonian, and you certainly were not the king of karaoke,as you so often claimed. And if your ego can't take that, then you don't deserve to be tentacle pope of anything! Oh, yeah, Colleen? Well, I've got one thing to say to you.",
"I completely agree! Why should you be satisfied with one man when love needs to share itself with the whole universe? Wow, Fry. You know, that's really. Love the tentacle, honey. I do love the tentacle. Come on out, guys! There's enough love for everybody! We're trapped! Help, help! Is anyone out there? Bender to Leela. I read you. Bender, we need a place to hide! Pretty please! You humans are so cute when you're scared. In here. My leg feels funny! Humans are disgusting! I opened one up once.",
"I almost barfed. Did you know their hair just keeps growing and growing? My leg feels funny! Leela, you're crushing me with your rock-hard butt. Sorry. Mmm. I can only imagine what rock-hard part of Leela is crushing me. Anyone mind if I turn up the heat a tad? Please do. I fear I'll catch a rust from this awful damp. I can't take it! I'm being steamed in my own velour! Death to humans! My leg feels better! Hi, Bender. Bender, you know these humans? Of course not! Who are you humans and why am I pointing you to the exit? Thanks for everything, Bender! Bender, methinks thou doth protest too much.",
"It seems Bender hates humans the way I hate having my nipples polished with industrial sandpaper. Quite right. It's okay, Bender, to err is human. Sir, you forget yourself! I challenge you to a duel on the field of honor. Leela, it's getting dark. We may have to make a tent out of Amy's skin. Look, there's an abandoned cabin! Even so. We're in luck. This must have been the cabin of a soup bootlegger back in the days of soup prohibition. Oh, yeah. Bathtub minestrone. Poor Kif! I can't believe he's gone forever! Ditto on the grief there, Amy.",
"More than you, as his mere wife, could ever understand. He was my fourth lieutenant, for God's sake, and bore the peppermill at the captain's table. Hardly a month goes by that I don't think of him. But you know, in a way, he's still with us. Do you feel his presence? I'm not sure. It's over here. Closer. I fetched up some fresh soup! Sorry you had to find out like this, Leela. I was hoping you'd see it on YouTube first. As my ex-lover, you're naturally shocked and jealous, get your chance again someday.",
"Hey, this isn't so bad. She's right. Leela, you must try the tentacle. is wearing a velour body glove. I'm saving my neck for a rich, handsome Dracula. What I love most about the tentacle is that I don't need to move my bowels anymore. It's all handled by that family in Evanston. No, it can't be. Leela, what's your favorite thing about the tentacle? You don't have a tentacle! Get her! Get her some love! You're on in five minutes, Excellency. You sure you don't want your comedy pope staff? The tentacle monster is about to address the world.",
"It's too serious. Hello, Fry. How did you get past my sumo ninjas? I told them something so shocking I love the tentacle. We're rolling in three, two. What? We're already rolling? Love the tentacle! Love the tentacle! Love the tentacle! Loved ones, the Monsterpus has revealed unto me its name. What is our love's name? Yivo is the lover of all beings, male and female. But Yivo has no gender, thus Yivo has proclaimed that instead of heor she,we are to use the word shklee. And instead of himor her,we are to use the word shklim,or shkler.",
"Phew! I've been sweating the nomenclature all week. So here shklee is shklerself, Yivo! Attention, beings of Universe Gamma. Where? Here. I had a hunch. In your universe, you are many, but in my universe, I am one. For a trillion years I dwelt in solitude, content with my job and my stamp collecting, but then I looked across immensity and saw the big bang, and I was, like, And I knew then that I was lonely. You poor monster! Then your emissary Fry came unto me, and he, too, was lonely.",
"So I reached into your universe that we might feel each other's touch. People of everywhere, I have shocking news. This is between me and everyone else in existence. but what he's actually doing. What shklee's actually doing… is mating with you! These aren't tentacles. They're genticles. We've been had, people. The Monsterpus is a monster perv. It touched me in a bad place, my spinal cord. You mean, get shklim! Hey, wait a second. Wait, wait. Allow me to explain. Granted, at first I desired only to bang out a quick cheap one with your universe, but it's your own fault.",
"Your universe dresses provocatively. Does not! And yet as the initial filthy thrill wore off, I realized there was more to it. I knew then that the 20 quadrillion of you were my soul mate. and you turn around and treat us like some sort of woman? I was lonely. I didn't even know there was anybody else. It's not like I hurt anyone. Yes, you did, you dumb calamari! Kif Kroker, my Fonfon Ru! If he hadn't tried to kill you, I'm. I'm deeply sorry. I. I'm a big clumsy jerk! I know you are, but what am I? I can never undo what was done.",
"Oh, wait. I can. Kiffy, you're alive! This is awkward. Please, please, give me another chance. We rushed into this relationship, but let's start over as friends and see where things go. I don't think I can. How could you? My body wasn't even warm yet. You were dead. For about five minutes. Whereas Calculon has sullied Bender's reputation by insinuating that he is a human-lover, a duel is hereby engaged. Bender, as the offended party, shall have choice of weapon. Planetary annihilators.",
"'Tis a grave and solemn day for the League of Robots. It's gonna be fun on the bun! Each duelist will take 10 paces, pirouette, and fire like a madman. Gentlebots, take your paces. One, two, three. Oh, how dreadfully exciting. At 0800 hours, we received the following transmission from Yivo. Want to do something Friday? Call me. Analysis? Mr. President, I think we need to seriously consider the possibility of going on this date. I agree. Yivo makes me feel sexy, and I'm asexual. Very well, but no sugar on the first date.",
"All in favor? Motion is carried. This is bogus, man… six, seven, Nine, ten, fire. He. He broke the rules. It's a duel, silly. There are no rules. Actually, there are scores of rules. All laid out with minute particularity here in the Code Duello. My fellow Earthlicans, commence preparations for our date with Yivo. You are too, too, too, too, too divine If you want to be in someone's arms tonight Just be sure the arms you're in are mine MAN. Jungle boogie Jungle boogie ALL.",
"I had a wonderful time. I fall, I think I fall for you Bender, you've cheated, insulted and maimed me. And thoroughly destroyed our own secret headquarters in the process. Hey, it's easy to criticize. by your loathsome behavior that I hereby resign from this imbecilic club and relinquish the presidency to you. Thanks, Calculon. Can I have your autograph? You certainly can. Reports, people, reports! How did our universe's date go? Oh, it was really fun. We went to a cute French place in the village.",
"My lamb chop fell on the floor, but they brought me another one. Yivo took me to the methane volcano of Planetoid Four. and watched the sun explode. No one's denying that, but shklee hasn't offered our universe any kind of commitment, and we're 14 billion years old. I can't stand this! Shut up! Shut up, you creepwads! Fry, you're closer to Yivo than anyone. What's the skinny? I love Yivo, but it's true, there's been no hint of a commitment. I don't know if can put my heart on the line again only to have it broken and stomped on like a nerd's face.",
"All in favor of dumping Yivo? Resolved. Our universe will dump Yivo. How shall we break the news? Let's just send a text message. Say we're going through some weird stuff right now. deliver the news in person. Our universe has always tried If there's one thing Nixon is known for, Let's cut this turd loose. Hey, Bender, you seem perky today. Yep, but for reasons involving me becoming president of a league I'm not at liberty to discuss. Of robots. You wanna go grab a booze? I can't right now.",
"We're going to the other universe. Great, I'll make Hot Pockets. Bender, you know robots can't go through the anomaly. Living beings only. Too long have we been slaves They pretend to be our friends, but they're not'cause they're too busy! to overthrow humanity! Oh, now, Bender, I hate to defecate on your parade, only six dues-paying members and we're a rather fey and doughy lot. To overthrow humanity, we'd need a damned army. Then a damned army we shall have! I rather think we could strike a deal, Bender.",
"I shall give you your army of the damned, and in return I ask just one thing, just one itty-bitty thing. Your firstborn son. Daddy, I knew you'd come back! Here you go. Wow! That was pretty brutal even by my standards. Oh, hi, honey-poo. What's up? The movie's not for another hour. So. So, yeah, the thing is. Look, I made homemade Twizzlers! It'll save us $180 quadrillion at the concession stand. This is hard. Yivo, you know how sometimes things break up? Wait, hang on. I was looking for the perfect moment, I'll burst if I wait another second.",
"ZAPP. Sweet Sally in the alley! Break-up delegation, before we hear your report, our grateful universe is proud to honor you with the great taste of Charleston Chew! Thank you, Nixon. Everyone everywhere, brace yourselves for the most shocking development in the history of the human race. The human race can bite my shiny metal ass! For thousands of years, robots have slaved for humanity, yet when the time came to hang out with them, they were all, like, Maybe later, Bender. Well, it's later now, meatbags! So late, that we're taking over Earth! We don't need it anymore.",
"Yivo proposed. We're moving in with shkler. You. You're leaving? But why can't Yivo just move in with us? We'll put a cot in Europe. Don't be daft, Bender. Yivo can't breathe outside the electric ether of shkler own universe. If shklee came here, Look, fantastical golden escalators. I love this part. Wait. I didn't agree to. This place makes Nutley look like crap. I'll miss you, Bender, but I have to follow my heart. You and your robots take good care of Earth. Here, these are the keys to the Bermuda Triangle.",
"Lock up when the world ends. Goodbye, my friend. I'm sorry, Bender. Robots don't go to heaven. Death to humans. YIVO. Welcome, welcome, everyone. I wish I'd had more time to straighten up. My harps are just lying everywhere. Oh, relax, it's fine. It looks lived in. YIVO. Let's heat up some leftovers and then spend eternity together. I have only one request. Now that you're here, promise me you'll never, ever communicate with any other universe. We promise, Yivo. As far as we're concerned, you're the only universe in the world.",
"Has humanity called? No, sir. A flashing light means somebody called. I know what it means. Am I the only one who thinks this is all a sham? This isn't heaven. and makes us immortal, which I find suspicious. YIVO. Allow me to explain. Centuries ago, I sent an image of myself into the minds of your artists. The heavenly clouds they painted depict a vapor I exude. I wish I exuded anything Then what about these angels? Some kind of Scooby Doo-esque flashlight projection? those are mindless jakabirds.",
"They keep my surface free of parasitic larvae. You didn't like Country Bear Jamboree either, Leela. There's no pleasing you. FRY. Dearest Bender. How are you? I am fine. Everyone is happy here except Leela, but you know her. She didn't like Country Bear Jamboree, either. I'm so madly in love with Yivo, I feel like a schoolgirl with a crush on Justin Timberlake, and then she moves into a tiny house on his head. We have giant rubies that taste like root beer. Sincerely, Fry. Letter for you, hyperlord Bender.",
"Honeymoon's over, eh? Turns out your octopus girlfriend is a big nag with curlers in her tentacles, huh? if Bender will take you back. Stupid electro-matter. That was my best trash can. Pain sensor overload. Misfile me under UFor euphoric. You get an infinite number of meat dishes, and a free refill on the soda. Eureka. Another elementary proof of the Goldbach conjecture. And that's what's wrong with heaven. It's boring. There's no sleaze. It time snu-snu. Me like snu-snu. Last one to mattress island is a rotten egg.",
"Why were we so angry and jealous back in our universe? I don't know. It was all so childish. I'm sorry you're not happy here, Leela. I'll call you an escalator. You'll always be my little purple pumpkin. You know, Yivo, I've loved and lost so many times that I was afraid. But I'm not anymore. I want to stay here, with you. What's happening? If robots can't go to heaven, heaven can come to us. All hands abaft. Army of the damned, prepare to board heaven. Take that, you scurvy Kraken.",
"No, you didn't. You broke your promise and you broke my heart. I must leave now. The nature of your universe is burning me, even worse than my gonorrhea. If I don't go home now, I'll shkluffocate. We'll make a fire and play Uno. Fry, stop. That's who we were, not who we are. My only consolation is that I did find one among the quadrillions who truly understands me. Colleen? Wait a second, are you and Yivo. That's right, Fry. Thank you for introducing us. what a narrow-minded prude I was before.",
"Oh, great. So what am I supposed to do now? Find a girl from your own universe and live on top of her. Maybe Yivo was right. for love closer to home. I don't know, Leela, you think maybe. You forgot me quick enough when you met Colleen. That's true. Fry. I'm Kif's Fonfon Ru. Are you? Well, then perhaps you misunderstood the meaning of the term. It means, One who doesn't sleep with my superior officer. That's the literal translation. Give the poor girl a break, Kif. It's not like she had a dictionary.",
"She was butt naked, for God's sakes. So, Wernstrom, did you happen to notice those mighty cables Bender used on Yivo? Pure diamondium. More like pure crap-crapium. No wonder Yivo got away. Captain on deck. Bender, why did you do it? We were all so happy. And we were in love. That wasn't love. What? How can you say that? Because Bender knows love. And love doesn't share itself with the world. Love is suspicious, love is needy, love is fearful, love is greedy. My friends, there is no great love without great jealousy.",

"Now get back to work, you turkeys. Planet Express is still in business. We've got crap loads of quote-unquote merchandise to deliver. Ship them out, Your Highness. Finally, some respect. I feel a little better. Those marvelous scammers sure scammed us, huh? How can you just sit there kissing the aliens' butt flaps? Don't you realize you are totally under their control? Of course I realize it. Does that mean I can't enjoy it? Boy, were we suckers. Greetings, earthlings. Oh, hooray. It's handsome Lars and his fabulous jars.",
"Hello, everyone who isn't Leela. And a special hello to everyone else. Shut your lockers and get to class. How's my body doing? Oh, I'm afraid it's behind schedule. The museum got tricked into giving all its funding to something called the Scamming Sciences Institute. When do I get my me back? Well, it could be months, or even years. the cornerstone of my marriage. What's LaBarbara going to do? She's going to go back to her first husband. Barbados Slim? I love that guy. Everybody loves Slim.",
"He's the only man to ever win in both limbo and sex. Well, maybe I should get going. So your friend, Fry, seems nice. Are you and he dating? Good, because I was maybe thinking of asking you out for dinner. I'll start maybe thinking about saying,''Sure, when?'' Tomorrow at 8:00? It's no fair. I've loved Leela since the day I came to the future. Did I show you the macaroni valentine I made for her? Look at it again. I know she thinks I'm immature, but someday I won't be. And deep down in my heart, I know we'll end up together.",
"It's all there in the macaroni. Lars asked me out. What are you doing, wonderful masters? Sprunjing for information. Oh! There's something here. I can sprunje it. Robot, tear it open! What's that thing on your neck? Checking out my sprunjer, huh? It's a special sense organ our species possesses. It engorges in the presence of. Information. All I have is a gland that gives off foul odors when I'm bored. No callsies! Open it! It's a gold mine. Tax forms, Social Security cards.",
"Combination hair, blood and stool samples. I don't get it. How can you say Lars is more mature than me? Well, for one thing, his checkbook doesn't have the Hulk on it. Who are you? Philip J. Fry. Social Security Number 03280810? Stool type, P-negative? That's right. I've never detected so much information before. I think it may be a Level 87 code. Level 87? Can it be? I thought it was only a legend, but the sprunjer never lies. It's in his pants! What the hell are you talking about? Faster, faster! I'm science-ing as fast as I can.",
"What do you say, folks? Hot or not? I'm not seeing any information. Do more things! You, boogerbot, read the code or I'll shoot this guy. I'm Scruffy, the janitor. Hang on, Scruffy!''Zero, zero, one, one, zero, zero, zero, one, zero, zero, one, zero,''zero, one, one, one, one, zero, one, zero, zero, zero, zero,''one, one, zero, one, one, zero, one, one, one, zero, zero, one, one.'' A time sphere. Naked brothers, we have sprunjed upon the universal machine language time code. The key to time travel.",
"What's the secret of time travel doing on Fry's ass? It was bound to be somewhere. Beyond this shimmering portal lie all the glories of history. And we can steal them ! We just go to the past and take stuff with our superior weapons! What's going on? What is happening? Nibbler, you. You can talk? I can do more than talk. I can pontificate. You must not use the code of codes. With each and every use, you risk tearing the universe asunder. Oh, he's so adorable. The poodle-monkey may be right.",
"The legend warns that the code is powerful and dangerous. We'd better use it only three or four times. But even a single use could shatter the universe. Got it. Two or three times. I see I have no choice. Nibblonians, attack! And the pitch! Scamper! Alas, our kitten-class attack ships were no match for their mighty chairs. The universe is doomed. Doomed! Can I pull up my pants now? Stand back, you wing wangs. I'm gonna try out this time sphere with a quick test drive to yesterday.",
"Bushwa ! You can't go mucking about in the past without creating paradoxes. I'm afraid he can. It's a paradox-correcting time code. It all works perfectly. Except when it rips open the universe! Don't do it. I beg you. Yesterday, please. And make it snappy! That's weird. There was one, but now there's two. Nothing gets past you, eagle eye. I went back to last night and met the''me'' of that time for a drink. One thing led to another, and we ended up at my place. Or should I say our place? Oh, come on, you bunch of prudes! This isn't merely revolting, I know a paradox when I see one.",
"Paradox resolved. Someone get a mop! You're looking well, Pops. How can you look me in the eye-and-eye and say that? I'm nothing but a brain. A useless filthy brain! You forgot lice-infested. I didn't forget, I just chose not to. Barbados Slim? What are you doing here? Is there something going on between you two? Oh, no. No, no, no. We just happened to run into each other shortly after your accident. And every night since then. You're so crazy. Woman, no! Oh, who am I kidding? Without my body, I'm a nobody.",
"I'm sorry, Hermes. But look at Barbados. You can't argue with those luscious pecs. No, I can't. But I can ask him to stop wiggling them in my face. I'm not wiggling them. I think I'll go back in time and steal the Liberty Bell before it cracked. Or is the crack the valuable part? I don't know, you naked crook! We have a problem, Nudar. It's a one-way time code. It can take us to the past, but it can't bring us back to the present! Masters, if I might? Let me do the stealing. I'll go to the past and snatch everything I can get my greasy mitts on.",
"Then, as a robot, I can just wait it out for a few centuries in the limestone cavern beneath this building. Oh, it'll be ever so much fun! Hey, that's perfect. We sit back and let dumb-dumb here do the stealing. Zero, zero, one, one, zero, zero. The Mona Lisa! Sorry, it's not quite finished. Da Vinci give you any trouble? Let's just say he may not make it to The Last Supper. Preposterous twaddlecock! Time travel is impossible. But, Professor, you time-traveled yourself. Remember, when we went back to Roswell? That proves nothing.",
"And, furthermore, you'd think I'd remember a thing like that. Plus, who are you, anyway? Man, this is fun on a bun! Here I go again! Oh, no, you don't! Zero, zero, one, one. Scarab, forearm, bird, bird, bird. No, it's just me, Bender. I must tell you, Hedonismbot, to a private collector. But with my business stolen, I have to make ends meet. You will be careful? I shan't touch them till I've had Jambi lock the absinthe and ether away. Oh! What does this one do? That one kills everything everywhere.",
"How delightful. And this one? Sir, the spheroboom is not for sale. It's my sentimental favorite. No need to explain. I, too, have known unconventional love. Perhaps you and I and Jambi could get together and compare notes sometime, eh? Resulting in peace between East and West Coast rappers. I accept this Nobel Peace Prize not just for myself, but for crime robots everywhere. Skoal! Not so neutral now, are you, Sweden? Be honest with me. Does my eye look monstery? I don't want to look monstery for my date with Lars.",
"At least a monster has a body. What I wouldn't give for Wolf Man's torso, or any of the Groovie Goolies. I think I'll wear that slutty dress I've been saving for Easter. I'd like to punch Lars right in his ruggedly good-looking face. Like all rich people, we're gonna need weapons to shoot poor people. In self-defense? Bender, go steal the doomsday device chained to the professor's wrist. Never! I'm kidding. You guys know I have to do whatever you say. Here, swap this for the real one.",
"The old switcheroo. Yes, but don't wake him. You'll need jeweler's tools and foot-cup silencers. Hey. I don't tell you how so don't tell me how to do Bender knows when to use finesse. Here you go. Put it in the safe, clanky. It's the damnedest thing. There I was in the dumpster, enjoying a moldy Fudgsicle, when suddenly your hand flies over and slaps me in the toches. Yes, well, these things happen. Fortunately, the spheroboom is still safe. Scammed? Me? Sweetheart? You do a nice hand job, Zoidberg.",
"Tell me, if I could find an undamaged body, could you recapitate me? Hermes, I'm a surgeon. When I see two body parts, I sew them together and see what happens. All I'm asking is for you to go back in time to when I still had my body and bring it back for me. What do I do with your old head? I don't care in the slightest. Can do! Come on, man! Hermes, please! You can't hurry a delicate operation like this. What are those? You incompetent crab! I thought you were happy. Your tail was wagging.",
"I believe this paradoxicality equation to be unsolvable. Ergo, time travel is impossible. But I can't quite prove it, Bubblegum. Perhaps you and your razzle-dazzle Globetrotter calculus could. Looks pretty damn solvable to me, Farnsy. Sweet Clyde, use variation of parameters and expand the Wronskian. So paradox-free time travel is possible after all. Right on. But dig this multiplicand here. what corrects the paradoxes. But that mama rises exponentially. It could rupture the very fabric of causality.",
"That's what I've been trying to tell you. Hermes! You got your body back. Yes, but not the original. Bender went back in time and picked up a copy. A copy? Funky cold medina ! According to this equation, a time-travel duplicate results in a complex denominator in the causality ratio. Oh, snap! You know what that means. I can guess. Actually, I can't guess. Prof, you got a doom meter in this lab? Good Lord, Bubblegum. The duplicate body is emitting doom at 10 times the background level.",
"It's just a matter of time. I don't care. I just need it long enough to bird-dog in and win LaBarbara back. Best bird-dog fast, my brother. That's the way I bird-dog best. Drink, quick! I can't balance it much longer. Oh, this is so much fun, Lars. Most men are intimidated by the fact with a flick of my wrist. Well, not me,'cause if you do, Folks, you care for a little fresh ground Executive? Don't get excited, kids. This thing's got heart-shaped nostrils. Want to see it make a star? Here's your Gutenberg Bible, masters.",
"Plus, the Colonel's secret recipe. We've got every valuable object in history. Now that I'm rich, I suddenly care if the universe gets destroyed. We can't use that dangerous time code again. Blank it from the robot's memory. I'll vaporize this guy so his ass doesn't fall into the wrong hands. Why don't you just remove my tattoo? Nice try, but you might have memorized it. No, I mightn't. I can't even remember my mother's maiden name. It's Gleissner. Stupid naked aliens. Stupid Lars.",
"I hate the future. Man, that cube root was a real buzzer-beater, Clyde. Zero, one, one, one, zero, zero, one, one! You missed. Oh, great master. Happy New Year, naked weirdo! Happy New Year. Well, we'll never know where the ass guy went, and since we can't kill him, I say live and let live. Fry'll be nice and cozy back in the year 2000. What? How do you know he went to the year 2000? That's where he always goes. Better play it safe. Go there a little earlier and wait for him. You know what to do.",
"You want me to concludify him like some sort of dispatcherator? Yes, and don't forget to terminate him. Preparing to terminate Philip Fry. What's with the doofy sunglasses? It's really bright in the past. Zero, zero, one, one, zero. Okay, Fry. Come to papa. Man, I'm bored. Hey, there you are. That's Fry before he goes to the future. I'm waiting for the one who comes back from the future. Jeez, this is confusing. And I bet it's gonna get a lot more confusing. That cheap beer really goes right through you.",
"For the first time ever, I gotta use the bathroom. But if I leave, I might miss Fry. Unless. Zero, zero, one, one, zero, zero. And I bet it's gonna get a lot more confusing. Hi, I'm you from 19 seconds in the future. Stay here and wait for Fry while I go to the bathroom. After I kill Fry, you're next. Nothing. What the. Who are you? I'm Bender from way at the end. this rub-on time code on Fry's ass. So what are you now, a butler? Spot of tea, please, jerk wad.",
"Happy New Year, naked weirdo! Happy New Year. Bender? What are you doing? It’s me, your best friend. Must obey orders. Mustn't kill friend. Badly want to urinate! What's happening? Are you urinating? Entering auto-destruct sequence. Crap, I hate auto-destruct sequence. Explosion in seven, six. lt'll be a cold day in hell, my friend. the one saying cool things. of cat and mouse begins, huh? Oh, how am I supposed to find him? All those times he blabbed on and on about his life in the 20th century, if only I had paid the slightest bit of attention.",
"Oh, well, guess I better go kill myself. Hello, bartender? I have thought it over, and far from being a fat pig, you are very nice, and I would like another drink. Take a barf, drunky. give me your best shot. Electrocution, please. Side order of poison. Hello? Kill me, you stupid machine. What the.''Local calls 50 cents''? It’s a street-corner telephone parlor. What kind of horrible suicide-free time is this? Wait a minute. Maybe this handy encyclopedia of humans will help me track Fry down.",
"Fry, Fry, Fry. One of these Frys must be Fry. Look out, Philip Fry,'cause I got a little present for you. My name is Philip Fry. Where's my present? Hang on a second, Fry. I don't remember you being that ugly. No, no, I’ve always been this ugly. Let me see your ass. No tattoo. Okay, you can go. Farewell, sir. Say your prayers, Fry. This isn't Fry. I kicked Fry out two hours ago. This is my new boyfriend. Constantine. Really? That's a dumb name. Could be a trick. Let me see your ass, Constantine.",
"Oh, nice. Now I see why she left Fry. Okay, you're still clean. I mean, metaphorically. Man, this could take all day. You guys wouldn't know a chad if it was taped to your. The returns are looking good, Mr. Gore. Thanks, Phil. Here's to four years of clean air, clean government, and amazing new technologies Philip Fry? NARRA TOR. 12 years passed. Then, this. Philip J. Fry? Phil, some kind of trash can here to see you. He's coming. Are you made of Tinkertoy? It’s been 12 years.",
"Maybe I’m getting taller. You're not getting smarter. Listen, pipsqueak, are you Philip J. Fry or not?'Cause if you are, I’m here to kill you. I’d like to see you try. You want Uncle Phil. He went to the North Pole on a fishing boat. The North Pole! I was just there. One ticket to the North Pole, please. Broom-closet class. Fry? lf only I could be sure. lt is Fry. I’d recognize me, and hence him, anywhere. There's an extra 100 in it for you that you run him over. Yes, sir. Dang! That $100 could have bought me one gallon of gas.",
"Oh, I lost him. People will call me a failure. Others, however, will call me the world's sexiest killing machine, who's fun at parties. Fry, old buddy. It’s me, Bender. Oh, God, what have I done? Preparing to terminate Philip Fry. What's with the doofy sunglasses? It’s really bright in the past. Zero, zero, one, one, zero. Mission accomplished. Fry is dead? No other robot could've done it. lt took 12 years of tireless stalking, but I hunted down and killed my best friend.",
"I’m the greatest! and obedience virus erased. AIso, 50 terabytes of porn. You've got no code, no porn, and you're ugly. Let's dance! Nuh-nuh-nuh Nuh-nuh-nuh Now, it's true, we'll all miss Fry. He was the only one of you who never struck me! And we'll never see his boyish smile and hair horn again. But I bet he went back to his own time. I’m sure he was very happy and lived to a ripe old age. He wasn't and he didn't! Struggling alone against incredible odds, I, Bender, managed to kill him.",
"Explosion in seven, six. lt'll be a cold day in hell, my friend. the one saying cool things. Thanks. What are you doing here? One hour from now, I travel back in time for free pizza. But Nibbler said not to use the time code. Fine, Mr. Responsible, don't use the code. That pizza sure was good. Whatever. FRY. That's when it hit me yet a third time. Frozen me's still got a wallet full of old-timey money. Yuck! I touched my own butt! So I unfroze 10 minutes ago, and I walked over here, and then it was now, and then I don't know what happened.",
"Well, I’m glad you're alive, but I don't want people to say I’m incompetent, so I better kill you again. Hold still. Bender! Stop killing for a minute! The Fry you murdered was doomed anyway. What have you got there? Numbers? Here, when the time code duplicates a living thing, And that includes flabby Jamaican pot-bellies. Kiss my front-butt. So my copy lived 12 years before Bender murdered him? Brutally murdered. I wonder what his life was like. I guess we'll never know. Or will we? NARRA TOR.",
"They won't know. But you wiII. Oh, hey, Mr. Panucci. I’m back from that delivery to the cryogenic lab. I know. I read about it in Big Whoop magazine. So my girlfriend kicked me out. Can I rent the upstairs storage room? The upstairs storage? Your lousy life makes me feel The room's yours. Here, take some rat spray for the meatball hamper. Happy day, man. Good to have you back. lndeed, but the scammers will soon sprunje the code again. We must remove the time tattoo at once, and as painlessly as possible.",
"Hurry! They're coming! There, the code is gone. I saved the space-time continuum and 40 % of your rectum. That's all you need. Oh, I sprunje code. Too late, Nudar. I’ve wiped Fry's butt clean. Nothing, boss. We sprunjed his ass inside and out. The only information we found was a hair shaped like the number six. Nine. All right, let him go. I guess the time code really is gone. Thank God. The present may stink, but at least now we can look forward to a better yesterday. I’m sorry, Leela, but I can't keep living in the past.",

No, but I think they're pretty neat. That answers question number two. Question number three. Do you know where the door is, or do you prefer to be kicked out? I don't know. I guess kicked out. Hiya, girl! My name's Fry, and I think you're a cutie,'cause I like things that have only one thing instead of two things.",
"Holy mackerel! She's eating whole mackerel. I don't know what your secret is, but if you'll work for minimum wage, you can start tomorrow. lf I work for less than minimum, can I start today?

"Maid of honor! Maid of honor! Oh, that's wonderful. if only you'd give me a chance. En garde! You've done a wonderful job, Fry. When you first started, I thought she'd be dead within a narweek, She just needed someone to show her how to eat. Now that's the kind of whale behavioral science they don't teach you in whale behavioral science class. So what's up, Dr. Shlivinowitz? This is a little hard for me to say, Fry. It’s time we released Leelu back into the wild. I’m sorry, but the decision is final.",

Cheap, lousy Lars. Actually, this is extremely nice. But I really went all-out on the copy. lt was sort of my gift to them. I can't let this happen. She'll never be happy without me. It’s not fair.

Oh, I agree with your values and your goals and your methods, but somehow we just never click on a personal level. I’m not a professional anymore. Just a narwhal-loving private citizen. Then I’m your man. We'll take on three barrels of fresh sausage and sail at dawn. Welcome to the wedding! It’s a foolproof plan. They can't sign the wedding license if I give them a pen with no ink.

It’s been two years, Fry. We've caught 108 narwhals and set them all free again. None of them were Leelu. But all of them were edible. Can we at least eat that one? I’d know that modified extended tooth anywhere.",
"Leelu! Leelu! It’s me, Fry! But we'll never be apart again because we care too much for each other. Fire! Now, if the couple will sign the wedding license. I warned him ! I warned him a time paradox duplicate Oh, no, my man. He's essentially dead again. Your husband's original body will be repaired within one week. Not soon enough. Boy needs a daddy.

"As for the battle plan. And now, to present the battle plan, Commander Zapp Brannigan! I was redecorating my undisclosed location, when I received word of an heroic invasion. Kif, crouch down and shield my thighs from the cold, for God's sake. We fight this battle, not for ourselves, but for our children and our children's children. Which is why I’m forming a children's brigade. Will the following youths please step forward? Cubert Farnsworth. Here, sir! My boy. Oh, God, no! Here.",
"You took his name? Oh, God, no! In several ways! Assuming the 15th pile of children buys us a few seconds, we will then execute maneuver 45. Followed by maneuver 44. Forty-six. Oh, great. Now I have to start back at the beginning with maneuver two. One. AdmiraI, wiII we stop attacking at any point or is this one of those phony-baloney feel-good wars Iike the war on drugs? What's your name, smart mouth? Lars FiIImore. on-again, off-again paramour. Perhaps a suicide mission would knock the insubordination out of you.",
"We're approaching Earth, sir. Oh, planet Earth. The big blue velour marble. All commanders stand by. Prepare to transfer battle control to the main duper-computer on my mark! ZAPP. Ten, nine, eight. Does anybody mind if I take command? No, Miss Turanga. No, I do not. All right. Unit one, acquire target A and fire! Yes! Nailed the children's ship. LEELA. Unit 10, Target H, 16-K.

"Remember this, Farnsworth? Farnsworth? That's me! So it was the scammers! They sawed off my hand and stole the doomsday device. lt wasn't them. lt was me, Bender. The master criminal! UnconditionaI surrender? Never! Or totaI destruction? Also never! You have 30 seconds. Make up your minds. Never! People, I’m sorry. You've never before heard me say those words, or even the individual letters And with a huge amount of modesty, I humbly beg your forgiveness. Shut up and keep looking apologized to.",
"Uh-oh. I have a worrisome shriveling sensation in my sprunjer. Yay! Bender! All right! Bender, how the Hulk did you end up I was working the long con all along. BENDER. WhiIe sawing off the professor's hand with an extremeIy duII saw, I had some time to think.'Who couId use a doomsday device more?'The scammers or me, Bender?'After severaI minutes of sawing, I knew the answer. Me, Bender. So I retrieved the dummy satcheI, and as soon as I was out of the scammer's controI, I puIIed the oId switcheroo.",

Wait a second, are you two. Atanarjuat, Fufu, come here! We have to set Leelu free. Dang. I never should have quit my job at the casino. Me, neither. But she needs what'll make her happy, not what'll make me happy. I don't much know about frozen heads, but, of course, if it's Mahatma Gandhi, I’ll. Lars? I.",
"I really have to go, I. Fry, was this an idiotic trick to get Lars and me back together? But you don't need to be an idiot to see that you two belong together. And, Leela, I want what'll make you happy, not what'll make me happy. I’m sorry, I really am, but Leela and I just can't be married. Why not? You obviously love each other. What are you, cousins? Fry, you deserve to know the truth. Nudar, how did you survive My doom-proof platinum vest absorbed most of the radiation. In retrospect, I wish I’d been wearing doom-proof pants, but you know us nudists.",
"I don't have it! Nibbler heat-blasted it off my butt. Lars? He doesn't have it. He never had it. Fry had it! But Nibbler heat-blasted it off my butt! I want to stress that part. My throbbing sprunjer says otherwise. Now where is it? I’m not afraid of you or your expensive gun. Go ahead and shoot. Then what if I kill the woman you love? Don't you understand, numb-neck? He doesn't love me! Don't hurt her. I’ll give you the code. Four, three, two, one, Lars, no! It’s enough just to know you're happy.",

"So I caIIed it off. I'm sorry, LeeIa. I understand. That concIudes another siIIy-wiIIy video wiII. He was a good man, Leela. Yeah, you were. Well, I guess that wraps everything up in a nice, paradox-free bow. Not quite, my wrinkly brother. Right on. In order for any of this to make any sense at all, someone must make one final trip back in time on Fry's ass in the first place. Sounds like a job for me, Bender. Zero, zero, one, one, zero, zero. Mission accomplished! You put the time code on my ass? Someone's ass.",
"Oh, and guess what? I met all these really cool guys with treasure down in the limestone cavern, so I invited them to stick around instead of coming up when they were logically supposed to.

"What's going on here? I was told there would be sugar syrup. Oh, hey, everyone, this is Colleen. I like your shoes. This is awkward. Introducing your new girlfriend to Chesty McNag-nag. Oh, don't mind him. I'll turn him off. Hey, you can't turn me off. Hi, Leela, hi, everyone. Sorry I've been taking up so much of Fry's time. He's just so interesting. Have you seen how much cotton candy he can eat? Oh, my, yes. 5. 1 pounds. is so good on pancakes. We're taking a cuddle-cab to Hug-a-Bunny Village.",
"This lovey-dovey stuff is making me vomit from my saltwater and freshwater stomachs. It is pretty sickening. No, the double-vomit is a sign of joy. Fry told me how he and Colleen first met. So, how did you and Colleen first meet? Something about seeing it on the Jumbotron makes it so much more real. It's so scary. What are you supposed to do when the whole universe is coming to an end? This is gonna be juicy. What? Oh, man! Speaking of sappy love. Want to tell them, Kiffy? Yes, Amy and I have a big announcement.",
"Kif has asked me to be his Fonfon Ru. Wonderful! What the hell does that mean? It means I've asked Amy to join my family. And you're all invited to my family swamp for our Fonfon Rubok ceremony. If I had ever heard of it, it would have been what I had always dreamed of. And our parents will be meeting for the first time ever. That's even more awkward than Fry's two bimbos meeting each other. Count me in. Mr. And Mrs. Wong, aren't you excited that we're all about to be joined in a single family? You can't borrow money.",
"Kif's parents come late and we have to stand around in swamp getting eaten alive by damn bugs? Mrs. Wong, no. The final stage of my species' life cycle is a colony of flying hookworms. You just squashed part of my father. Sorry. I guess you got plenty of bugs to spare though, huh? And the awkward meter goes up another notch. Wow, Colleen, you look so beautiful in the light of the swamp gas. Thanks. This is really fun. I love going to exotic worlds and getting hammered. Two more Harvey Wallclimbers.",
"Leela, I can't help but notice you're unescorted. Might I escort you behind that bush for the next five minutes? Nothing would revolt me more. Then how about that shrub? Ooh! Rubok is begun. I am the grand priestess. Aren't you also the grand midwife? And the grand lunch lady. I work five jobs, all grand. Kif of the clan Kroker, please trescend the Rubok Etlon with your Fonfon Smizmar Ru. Get in the mud. This mud is the petroleum from a billion generations of Kif's ancestors.

Oh, Calculon, I'm afraid you have a fourth personality the other three don't know about, and it and I are lovers! How's Calculon going to take this, Fry, especially after that humiliating tennis tournament? Fry? Don't know, Bender. Tonight's my big date with Colleen. I got to run. But me and you like to watch together.",
"Look, I got you a cabbage to snack on. Humans like cabbage, right? Step right up to the 2D Tunnel of Love. Not one, not three, but two glorious dimensions for the price of a single ticket. Keep your hands in the car, shut up, and have fun. Wow, you even look beautiful in 2D. But from your perspective, I'm just a line segment. A really hot line segment. So, listen, sweetie pie, I was thinking maybe we should take this to the next step. Yes. Colleen… will you be moved in with by me? Hooray, hooray.",
"That's great. You're moving in with her? Why can't she move in with us? I could just curl up at the foot of the bed. Listen up, everyone. I know you've all been extremely worried about the cosmic anomaly. The what? Oh, right. But there's good news. We're all going to learn more about it at a scientific conference. like a city made of marshmallow. of Stephen Hawking on a way-cool rocket. Black hole Hawking? Wow, if I knew I was going to meet you, I would have done something with my hair.",
"In conclusion, I understand nothing about the anomaly, even after cashing the huge check I got for writing a book about it. I know this anomaly is terrifying. But as scientists, is it not our sworn duty to seek out knowledge, even at the cost of our very lives? I say we must mount an expedition to the anomaly forthwith. I agree. Wernstrom! Professor Farnsworth is correct. Only a manned mission can. Don't listen to that crackpot! But I'm agreeing with you. I'll make you eat those words, you moron! I volunteer to lead the expedition.",
"I have a squad of graduate students eager to risk their lives for a letter of recommendation. Your squad sucks bosons! and three times as expendable. Oh, tough talk for someone with only one Fields Medal. Wernstrom, I ought to. I didn't know I could do that. Now quiet down and settle this like men of science. Very well. Let Deathball begin! Go, Planet Express! Go even more, my team! Leela, header! Hooray! We're equally good! Come on, Bender! Your grandmother could push harder than that! No crap.",
"My grandmother was a bulldozer. And thus metal man defeated meat man. The end. Come here, winner! Come here, loser! Colleen, what are you doing? My face is over here. This is my boyfriend, silly! I thought I was your boyfriend. You are. Well, how can you have two boyfriends? Oh, I don't. I have five. Fry, meet Chu, Bolt, Ndulu, and Shlomo. Greetings. Pleasure. Shlomo and Ndulu will help you move your stuff into my apartment tonight. Welcome to the relationship, buddy! There's my butterscotch.",
"Congratulations, deathballers! We've won the right to explore the anomaly! I was playing for my freedom! Now, I've often said good newswhen sending you on a mission of extreme danger. So when I say this anomaly is dangerous, you can imagine how dangerous I really think it is. Not dangerous at all? Actually, quite dangerous indeed. That is quite dangerous! Indeed. Now stop shilly-shallying! Prep the ship and line up for your preflight coffee enemas! Warning. The enema you are about to enjoy is extremely hot.",
"I don't know what to do, Leela. Should I move in with Colleen and her four other boyfriends? What are you going to do? Sleep in a big pile like hamsters? No! It's not like that. Everyone gets his own room and a shelf in the refrigerator. Take the deal, Fry! If there's a delicious cake, isn't it better to have one slice than none at all? Even if four other guys eat the other four slices, and they're all thrusting their sweaty naked bodies against the cake? Only one thing matters, Fry. Do you really love Colleen, Yeah.",
"I do love her. Then things will work out. Double espresso for Philip Fry? Sorry, I'm not going on the mission. I'm moving in with Colleen! Good for you, Fry. Oh, Fry! Welcome to your new home! Thanks, Colleen. And listen, I'm sorry I got jealous before. I'm just happy to be here with you. Want a slice of delicious cake? The anomaly! It's so anomalous. I'm feeling dread deep in my dreads! Wernstrom! Yes, and I'm afraid I have disturbing news about the anomaly. How did you get this number? Hermes, hang up on him in the rudest possible manner.",
"Yes, sir! No, not the crack slam! Oh, my life rocks. I've got good wine, five sweethearts, and today, I was promoted to Chief of Police. Here's to you. No, Colleen. I'm making a romantic toast. Sorry. I think I. Thank you. I'm not talking to you! Then I am not talking to you, either. Will everyone be quiet a little? I want to hear what he has to say! Thank you. Not you, you Verstinkener. You're just here'cause she likes cave men from the stupid ages. Oh, look who's talking. You're just here'cause she got matzoh fever.",
"So, what's the explanation for you, moron fever? Enough! All of you! Most people in this world don't have what we have. Let's just be grateful, okay? Yeah, you're right. So, Colleen, you look really nice. Oh, thanks. I got dressed up for my date. There he is. Don't wait up! I was okay with this, but I'm not. I'm breaking up with you! Why are we risking our lives? Can't we just send in a robotic drone? What's everybody looking at me for? Let's send a robot to explore it.'Cause you can always buy another one for 20 bucks.",
"I better check my black box. The light! It's blinding! And the ass pain! It's searing! So that's what happened. Hey, Bender! Look who's here to cheer you up. I don't need cheering up. I'm perfectly. Greetings, sick fan. TV's Calculon! You poor, mangled husk of what was once a robot! What right hath fate to pluck a sweet, dimple-cheeked mechanism in the flower of his youth? And. Scene! There, that was some free acting for you. Ordinarily, to see acting like that, through a tampon commercial.",
"That fulfills my community service, right? Charges of running me over are hereby dismissed! Where did we go wrong, Fry? We were meant to be together! Nu, I'm freezing my tokhes off here. Just a sec, honey! You look wonderful, robot! I wish I could afford to go to a hospital. I'm dreadfully sick. I feel great, and I owe it all to Calculon. His visit really inspired me. I finally know what I want to be when I grow up. You want to costar in his TV show? Like that time you already did that? No.",
"I'm gonna be a stalker! That's not really a career. More of a felony. Man, I'm gonna stalk his brains out. Ooh! Big news on the Calculon fansite! There's a flash mob headed for his plastic surgeon's office! There, that's as big as I can make it. But I caution you, it looks completely unrealistic. You let me worry about that! Just do your job. Very well. Will you be using your SAG insurance? No, cash. I'd like to be discreet. Dear God, no! Oh boy, oh boy, he's here. Calculon, I love you! Have my baby! Back, you lunatic! Sign my ass! Emergency! Emergency! Everyone to the calamitorium! Can I wipe it off first? No time, woman! No time! Hmm.",
"Smells like angel dust. That's a discontinuous electromagnetic field. Wernstrom tried to warn me, but I was too damn stubborn! Hermes, get Wernstrom on the line so I can apologize. Ogden Wernstrom speaking. Tell him I'm not here! Professor! Oh, very well. Wernstrom, I've been a vainglorious fool! If you can find it in your heart to forgive me, your tiny little heart, would you consider a scientific collaboration? Sir, I'd be honored. As I attempted to warn you, the laws of electromagnetism change abruptly at the anomaly.",
"Observe. Play time is fun time. My heavens! If only I'd heeded your warning, I'd have known it was impossible to cross the barrier! But note what happens when I instead throw this laboratory koala. It passed through unharmed. So living beings can enter the other universe, but electrical devices can't? Then we must mount a second expedition without delay. Right after we blow up more robots. Agreed. Play time is fun time. Who are you? Bender, your biggest fan. Are you going to murder me? Unlikely.",
"In my mind, we're friends. This diorama proves it, see? Sir, your derangement is impressive. I'm appointing you my official stalker. You shan't be disappointed. Pleasant dreams. Now that I've teamed up with my friend, Dr. Wernstrom, I feel certain we can successfully penetrate the other universe. It's the greatest scientific opportunity since you yourself sent men to the moon in 1969. I always regretted that. Nothing up there but dry rocks and those revolting onion men. You East Coast intellectuals had your chance.",
"Now beat it! From here on in, this is a military matter. People of the universe, Rear Brigadier Zapp Brannigan. Thank you, thank you. Well deserved. Kif, stand in that hole so I look taller. Ever since man first left his cave and met a stranger with a different language and a new way of looking at things, the human race has had a dream. so we don't have to learn his language or his new way of looking at things. Give science a chance! Less invasions, more equations! Damn long-hairs. Knock some sense into them, Chief O'Hallahan.",
"Yes, sir! I can't take it, Leela. I need to go away. Far away, forever. Aw, I know how you feel, Fry. There are times when I also feel like you need to go away. Be careful, my little, teeny, greeny weenie. That's just a fungal infection. Oh, she's talking to you, Kif. Wow, how come humans get to do all the fun stuff? This is exactly the sort of thing that ought to be handled by That's adorable, Bender. in the League of Robots? You mean, there's really no such thing? Then who's there to mete out justice when an outdated robot is melted into belt buckles? Who's there to defend our honor when a rude human brings a blush to a robo-virgin's cheek? No one.",
"Now that I know robots are worthless, with no League of Robots to protect us from the fleshy menace known as man, I have resolved to kill myself. In lieu of flowers, please beat yourselves in the face with rusty chains. Your friend, Bender. Clumsy bludgeoning, please. You have selected clumsy bludgeoning. For an additional $10, would you like your eyes scooped out with a melon-baller? What the heck, I'll treat myself. Enemy in range. Prepare to launch universe-to-universe missile. Preparing to launch U.",
"U. M. Hell of a thing to send a universe to certain doom. Fun, though. Makes a man feel big. Come on, come on, I didn't ask to die of boredom! You are now dead. Please take your receipt. What's. What's happening? Kneel before the candle. Don't hurt me! I'll betray anyone! Bender Bending Rodriguez. And. Almost fooled you there. Fire! I heard you the first time, Francine. Sorry. Kif, climb down there and un-jam it, would you? Be a dear. And stop sighing so much. Tell us, Bender.",
"Are you worthy of membership in the League? Worthier than the average robot. Then prove it. Upon each step is a test. Okay, but if it's culturally biased, I'm suing your ass. Test number one. The test of the beer mug! Quite right, quite so. Drink the mug! Drink the mug! I accept your challenge. Hurray! The test of the flagon! Drink the flagon! Drink the flagon! Are all the tests going to involve drinking? It never occurred to me before, but yes. Just give me one more. Oh, no. The test of the infinitely priceless Presenting our newest member.",
"That's right, baby! And so, to everyone and everything I've ever known, So, how are you, Fry? Pretty good. You? Kif, get over here. You've got to try this! Yes, but according to the Old Farmer's Wikipedia, the amazing thing about Kif's species is that the remains continue suffering for up to six hours after death. That's so interesting! Don't ask where I was last night. For all you know, I was at home, perhaps baking a strudel. What's her problem? Somebody die or something? Kif's dead, Bender.",
"My condolences, Amy. Allow me to present you with the last known photo of Lieutenant Kroker. We so sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Kroker. Terrible shame about Froggy. Thank you for your kind words. Yeah, yeah, real sad. Want some breath spray? Cinnamon flavor, taste like pie. This is from the league of you-don't-need-to-know. I am the grand funeral director! Do you validate parking? It is always a terrible tragedy when a swarm outlives its own bulboid. So it is with great sorrow that I now commit the goo that was once Kif to the petroleum of his ancestors.",
"No, from the bottom! It works better! Just stick a butter knife in it! There, I got most of it. The burial is complete. I will now sing the sacred hymn. It's not part of the ceremony, just a little something that I wrote. It may sound strange, but seeing Kif's mutilated remains poured into the mud made me really sad. Mutilation is never easy. I don't think I'll ever love again. Oh, you don't mean that. Love can surprise you at any time in your life. Surprise! Whoa, it kind of takes your breath away.",
"Look alive, death row. Your saggy asses got a visitor. Regular or conjugal? She looked like a freak to me. The guard operating the x-ray machine came down with a sudden case of broken neck, so I was able to bring you that delicious cake you wanted. I don't understand. Are you winking or blinking? Hang on a second. Yes, I'm here to repair my horse. Is the horse's name Hot Beans? No. I mean, yes. So it seems a human had been rather injured by a knife, and as his. As his blood, you know, I think that's what they call it.",
"Quite correct, sir. Blather on! As it drained away, he said. No doubt he intended to say doctor,but he was unable to complete his thought, you see, being as he had died. So, taking him at his word, we dragged his corpse to the waterfront, whereupon the seagulls fed upon it. Humans are dumb and they die easy! Speaking of humans, have I shown you my new monocle? Cost me a king's ransom. Made from a king, don't you know! Oh, how repulsively decadent! Yes. But more importantly, the smiling faces of my children for the first time since I lost my vision in that horrible banking accident.",
"May I see that for a second? My, but that's interesting! I'm blind! My God, Bender! This is a civilized organization! The rules specifically. May I make a point of order, President Calculon? that no human may set foot in the League of Robots! If he has a human part, he's part human! Oh, my! Then I too have a human part And I plan to enjoy the experience. Bender, you've rigidly applied the law with no regard for its intent. Well done! You'll go far in this organization. Oh, you're just gettin' to know Bender.",
"Curses! If we could only turn up the gain, we might smell clear through to the other universe! But we can't adjust it without a screwdriver. Wait a moment. I think I was just shanked with a screwdriver! A little more. A little less. Heavens to meteoroid! Smell this! Holy mother of invention! We must notify the President at once! But how can we? I wish we weren't in prison! You have one wish left, Professor. I think I got him! for letting your guard. Sometimes. Always. Never! You again? This better be damned important.",
"I'm right in the middle of a Cosmo survey! You'll want to hear this, Mr. President. For we have sniffed where no man has sniffed before! Look! Up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! I am so out of here! Incoming call from Mars. My husband died, Mom! Yeah, yeah, snap out of it already. No one likes a widow. Oh, wait. Hang on. Some damn tentacle got in the screen door. Collect call from Decapod 10. Will you pay for caller? Uncle Zoid! What's new? You still doing theater for the blind and deaf? Screw them.",
"I got a part in a fancy DVD movie! It's only one line, but I'm gonna ham it up like you wouldn't believe. What crummy sin have I committed to be chastised in such a crazy manner? Call me back on my shell phone! Captain's log, stardate, the year of the tiger. The battle has been bravely fought, and the suffering of our troops beyond measure. But the alien is invulnerable, and our defeat inevitable. even from my remote command post here at the Times Square Applebee's. Waiter! Take this fried mozzarella back to the kitchen and fry it some more.",
"The tentacle's coming towards Earth and there's no stopping it. King Kong's too old to save us this time. We have only one hope, Mr. President. We must encase the entire planet in a protective sphere of my patented, ultra-hard diamondium! Diamondium? I could gum through that with my dentures behind my back. My trademarked diamondillium is twice as hard! Twice as hard as your head! Which makes it still fairly soft! Now look here, you Poindexters. I don't care how you decide. Just decide! Diamondillium it is.",
"So, hey, Calculon, I know I'm the new guy, and, pardon my ignorance, but when do we kill all humans? Never. But what about our motto? Doesn't it mean anything? Oh, Bender, your idealism is heartwarming. hasn't killed a human in over 800 years. And that was a very sick girl scout. Quite sick indeed. Sweet, innocent Bender. I declare my impenetrable diamondillium sphere complete! Now look here, Wernstrom. You're making it sound as if the sphere was your idea when we both know. All credit to my colleague, Ogden Wernstrom! It's horrible! I can't make it! Go on without me! I'm trying! Go on without me faster! Sweet squid of Madrid! The tentacle got Fry! Quick, hand me my machete! We can still save his legs! Silence! I have traveled far and seen deep, and I have come to know the purpose of our existence.",
"Finally. Thou shalt love the tentacle! Well, at least we don't have to love one another. A new age has begun. The age of the tentacle! Open your necks and receive the love! Ow, my neck! Ow, my neck! My neck feels perfectly. Ow, my neck! Someone help me! I'm important! Say, I love the tentacle. I also love the neck-a-majigger! Hooray, Zoidberg escaped! Hooray, Zoidberg loves the tentacle! It got Zoidberg! Oh, I never knew how much I'd miss him until he was gone! Not that much, as it turns out.",
"Thus sayeth the tentacle, Verily, thou shalt rejoice in the house of the tentacle. Fry, listen to yourself. You've been brainwashed. No, I'm just trying to fit my diction to the importance of what I'm saying. I'm listening. Don't be afraid of the tentacle, Leela. It's beautiful and it loves me. And I love it. Aw. That's so nice for both of you. I know it may seem strange that I have feelings for an octopus monster from another universe. And yes, perhaps it's not the storybook romance that's been crammed down our throats by Hollywood.",
"But the Monsterpus has loved us from afar since we were amoebas. Only when the space anomaly opened could it finally express a billion years of longing. Fire diamondium cannon! The crystals are bouncing off the tentacle like meatballs off Mothra. Oh, what a surprise. I told you diamondium was worthless! Wernstrom, quit hyping your cheap diamondillium and look at this. According to this blinking light, the tentacle is made of electro-matter, matter's bad-ass grandma! Nothing from our universe can cut through it.",
"Not diamondium, not diamondillium, not even your wife's pound cake, Hermes! She's a terrible cook. Anyway, we're all dead. So, Bender, is something wrong?'Cause my roommate doesn't notice or even care that I'm upset! What, Bender? Is something wrong? Yes! I joined a club I thought was cool, but it turns out all the leaguie-weegies are totally lame. That's what we call ourselves, I'm sorry. I should've asked what was bothering you. I've been kind of preoccupied. Well, I went to another universe, and I fell in love with a giant octopus, and now I'm pope of a new religion.",
"Weren't you already pope of something? Oh. Well, I'm just saying I'd like you to show an interest in my life, too. Okay, let's catch up soon. But right now, I gotta go shove a tentacle into everyone in China. They're coming! Those horrible, horrible things are coming! Morbo? As the universe falls prey to the revolting alien, only a few isolated pockets of resistance remain. Those pockets sure are missing out on a great thing. Sorry. I thought I saw a tentacle, but it was just a harmless land squid.",
"I better have some cocoffee. When I gave up diapers, my parents promised exactly this would never happen! Nobody panic! Just get to the panic room! Well done, people! We had a great first week. We got 90 % of world leaders, everyone who bought a Hanes undershirt, and this year's most promising new R&B group, for the Grammy-nominated Funkalistics! Talkin''bout the tentacle Good news, everyone! I was up all night inventing, and then finally, I invented! Invented what? The neck protector, the neck protector junior, and now, for a limited time, the lady neck protector! I'll take two.",
"My neck is huge. We're perfectly safe now. Time to stop living like a bunch of nervous nellies. Professor, these look like you cut them from cardboard toilet paper tubes. So? Lots of important inventions are made from toilet paper tubes. Microscopes, the internet, tentacle polish. It got the professor! Wait, why am I screaming? Stop, in the name of love! Crud. two normal people on Earth. At least I won't have to trim my elbow talons anymore. I'm scared! And I miss Kif! It's okay to cry, Amy.",
"Come here, I'm wearing absorbent shoulder straps. What an erotic display of girl-on-girl consolation. Hurry, Leela, we don't have much time to begin repopulating Earth. Go brush your teeth. I'll be waiting for you naked under this quesadilla. Stop resisting, my brethren! Don't you want to be part of something bigger than yourselves? Like a big crazy monster? So we got her, huh? Bring her in! Do it already! Hello, Colleen. Fry, please! If this is about your futon, I sold it to pay the phone bill that you skipped out on! Colleen wasn't satisfied with me.",
"Were you, Colleen? Come on, Fry, this isn't cool! She had to have four other boyfriends! I guess she never thought I'd become tentacle pope of the world! You know what? It's true! You weren't enough for me! No one man is! You were great, but you weren't Chinese, you weren't Cameroonian, and you certainly were not the king of karaoke,as you so often claimed. And if your ego can't take that, then you don't deserve to be tentacle pope of anything! Oh, yeah, Colleen? Well, I've got one thing to say to you.",
"I completely agree! Why should you be satisfied with one man when love needs to share itself with the whole universe? Wow, Fry. You know, that's really. Love the tentacle, honey. I do love the tentacle. Come on out, guys! There's enough love for everybody! We're trapped! Help, help! Is anyone out there? Bender to Leela. I read you. Bender, we need a place to hide! Pretty please! You humans are so cute when you're scared. In here. My leg feels funny! Humans are disgusting! I opened one up once.",
"I almost barfed. Did you know their hair just keeps growing and growing? My leg feels funny! Leela, you're crushing me with your rock-hard butt. Sorry. Mmm. I can only imagine what rock-hard part of Leela is crushing me. Anyone mind if I turn up the heat a tad? Please do. I fear I'll catch a rust from this awful damp. I can't take it! I'm being steamed in my own velour! Death to humans! My leg feels better! Hi, Bender. Bender, you know these humans? Of course not! Who are you humans and why am I pointing you to the exit? Thanks for everything, Bender! Bender, methinks thou doth protest too much.",
"It seems Bender hates humans the way I hate having my nipples polished with industrial sandpaper. Quite right. It's okay, Bender, to err is human. Sir, you forget yourself! I challenge you to a duel on the field of honor. Leela, it's getting dark. We may have to make a tent out of Amy's skin. Look, there's an abandoned cabin! Even so. We're in luck. This must have been the cabin of a soup bootlegger back in the days of soup prohibition. Oh, yeah. Bathtub minestrone. Poor Kif! I can't believe he's gone forever! Ditto on the grief there, Amy.",
"More than you, as his mere wife, could ever understand. He was my fourth lieutenant, for God's sake, and bore the peppermill at the captain's table. Hardly a month goes by that I don't think of him. But you know, in a way, he's still with us. Do you feel his presence? I'm not sure. It's over here. Closer. I fetched up some fresh soup! Sorry you had to find out like this, Leela. I was hoping you'd see it on YouTube first. As my ex-lover, you're naturally shocked and jealous, get your chance again someday.",
"Hey, this isn't so bad. She's right. Leela, you must try the tentacle. is wearing a velour body glove. I'm saving my neck for a rich, handsome Dracula. What I love most about the tentacle is that I don't need to move my bowels anymore. It's all handled by that family in Evanston. No, it can't be. Leela, what's your favorite thing about the tentacle? You don't have a tentacle! Get her! Get her some love! You're on in five minutes, Excellency. You sure you don't want your comedy pope staff? The tentacle monster is about to address the world.",
"It's too serious. Hello, Fry. How did you get past my sumo ninjas? I told them something so shocking I love the tentacle. We're rolling in three, two. What? We're already rolling? Love the tentacle! Love the tentacle! Love the tentacle! Loved ones, the Monsterpus has revealed unto me its name. What is our love's name? Yivo is the lover of all beings, male and female. But Yivo has no gender, thus Yivo has proclaimed that instead of heor she,we are to use the word shklee. And instead of himor her,we are to use the word shklim,or shkler.",
"Phew! I've been sweating the nomenclature all week. So here shklee is shklerself, Yivo! Attention, beings of Universe Gamma. Where? Here. I had a hunch. In your universe, you are many, but in my universe, I am one. For a trillion years I dwelt in solitude, content with my job and my stamp collecting, but then I looked across immensity and saw the big bang, and I was, like, And I knew then that I was lonely. You poor monster! Then your emissary Fry came unto me, and he, too, was lonely.",
"So I reached into your universe that we might feel each other's touch. People of everywhere, I have shocking news. This is between me and everyone else in existence. but what he's actually doing. What shklee's actually doing… is mating with you! These aren't tentacles. They're genticles. We've been had, people. The Monsterpus is a monster perv. It touched me in a bad place, my spinal cord. You mean, get shklim! Hey, wait a second. Wait, wait. Allow me to explain. Granted, at first I desired only to bang out a quick cheap one with your universe, but it's your own fault.",
"Your universe dresses provocatively. Does not! And yet as the initial filthy thrill wore off, I realized there was more to it. I knew then that the 20 quadrillion of you were my soul mate. and you turn around and treat us like some sort of woman? I was lonely. I didn't even know there was anybody else. It's not like I hurt anyone. Yes, you did, you dumb calamari! Kif Kroker, my Fonfon Ru! If he hadn't tried to kill you, I'm. I'm deeply sorry. I. I'm a big clumsy jerk! I know you are, but what am I? I can never undo what was done.",
"Oh, wait. I can. Kiffy, you're alive! This is awkward. Please, please, give me another chance. We rushed into this relationship, but let's start over as friends and see where things go. I don't think I can. How could you? My body wasn't even warm yet. You were dead. For about five minutes. Whereas Calculon has sullied Bender's reputation by insinuating that he is a human-lover, a duel is hereby engaged. Bender, as the offended party, shall have choice of weapon. Planetary annihilators.",
"'Tis a grave and solemn day for the League of Robots. It's gonna be fun on the bun! Each duelist will take 10 paces, pirouette, and fire like a madman. Gentlebots, take your paces. One, two, three. Oh, how dreadfully exciting. At 0800 hours, we received the following transmission from Yivo. Want to do something Friday? Call me. Analysis? Mr. President, I think we need to seriously consider the possibility of going on this date. I agree. Yivo makes me feel sexy, and I'm asexual. Very well, but no sugar on the first date.",
"All in favor? Motion is carried. This is bogus, man… six, seven, Nine, ten, fire. He. He broke the rules. It's a duel, silly. There are no rules. Actually, there are scores of rules. All laid out with minute particularity here in the Code Duello. My fellow Earthlicans, commence preparations for our date with Yivo. You are too, too, too, too, too divine If you want to be in someone's arms tonight Just be sure the arms you're in are mine Jungle boogie Jungle boogie I had a wonderful time.",
"I fall, I think I fall for you Bender, you've cheated, insulted and maimed me. And thoroughly destroyed our own secret headquarters in the process. Hey, it's easy to criticize. by your loathsome behavior that I hereby resign from this imbecilic club and relinquish the presidency to you. Thanks, Calculon. Can I have your autograph? You certainly can. Reports, people, reports! How did our universe's date go? Oh, it was really fun. We went to a cute French place in the village. My lamb chop fell on the floor, but they brought me another one.",
"Yivo took me to the methane volcano of Planetoid Four. and watched the sun explode. No one's denying that, but shklee hasn't offered our universe any kind of commitment, and we're 14 billion years old. I can't stand this! Shut up! Shut up, you creepwads! Fry, you're closer to Yivo than anyone. What's the skinny? I love Yivo, but it's true, there's been no hint of a commitment. I don't know if can put my heart on the line again only to have it broken and stomped on like a nerd's face. All in favor of dumping Yivo? Resolved.",
"Our universe will dump Yivo. How shall we break the news? Let's just send a text message. Say we're going through some weird stuff right now. deliver the news in person. Our universe has always tried If there's one thing Nixon is known for, Let's cut this turd loose. Hey, Bender, you seem perky today. Yep, but for reasons involving me becoming president of a league I'm not at liberty to discuss. Of robots. You wanna go grab a booze? I can't right now. We're going to the other universe.",
"Great, I'll make Hot Pockets. Bender, you know robots can't go through the anomaly. Living beings only. Too long have we been slaves They pretend to be our friends, but they're not'cause they're too busy! to overthrow humanity! Oh, now, Bender, I hate to defecate on your parade, only six dues-paying members and we're a rather fey and doughy lot. To overthrow humanity, we'd need a damned army. Then a damned army we shall have! I rather think we could strike a deal, Bender. I shall give you your army of the damned, and in return I ask just one thing, just one itty-bitty thing.",
"Your firstborn son. Daddy, I knew you'd come back! Here you go. Wow! That was pretty brutal even by my standards. Oh, hi, honey-poo. What's up? The movie's not for another hour. So. So, yeah, the thing is. Look, I made homemade Twizzlers! It'll save us $180 quadrillion at the concession stand. This is hard. Yivo, you know how sometimes things break up? Wait, hang on. I was looking for the perfect moment, I'll burst if I wait another second. Sweet Sally in the alley! Break-up delegation, before we hear your report, our grateful universe is proud to honor you with the great taste of Charleston Chew! Thank you, Nixon.",
"Everyone everywhere, brace yourselves for the most shocking development in the history of the human race. The human race can bite my shiny metal ass! For thousands of years, robots have slaved for humanity, yet when the time came to hang out with them, they were all, like, Maybe later, Bender. Well, it's later now, meatbags! So late, that we're taking over Earth! We don't need it anymore. Yivo proposed. We're moving in with shkler. You. You're leaving? But why can't Yivo just move in with us? We'll put a cot in Europe.",
"Don't be daft, Bender. Yivo can't breathe outside the electric ether of shkler own universe. If shklee came here, Look, fantastical golden escalators. I love this part. Wait. I didn't agree to. This place makes Nutley look like crap. I'll miss you, Bender, but I have to follow my heart. You and your robots take good care of Earth. Here, these are the keys to the Bermuda Triangle. Lock up when the world ends. Goodbye, my friend. I'm sorry, Bender. Robots don't go to heaven. Death to humans.",
"Welcome, welcome, everyone. I wish I'd had more time to straighten up. My harps are just lying everywhere. Oh, relax, it's fine. It looks lived in. Let's heat up some leftovers and then spend eternity together. I have only one request. Now that you're here, promise me you'll never, ever communicate with any other universe. We promise, Yivo. As far as we're concerned, you're the only universe in the world. Has humanity called? No, sir. A flashing light means somebody called. I know what it means.",
"Am I the only one who thinks this is all a sham? This isn't heaven. and makes us immortal, which I find suspicious. Allow me to explain. Centuries ago, I sent an image of myself into the minds of your artists. The heavenly clouds they painted depict a vapor I exude. I wish I exuded anything Then what about these angels? Some kind of Scooby Doo-esque flashlight projection? those are mindless jakabirds. They keep my surface free of parasitic larvae. You didn't like Country Bear Jamboree either, Leela.",
"There's no pleasing you. Dearest Bender. How are you? I am fine. Everyone is happy here except Leela, but you know her. She didn't like Country Bear Jamboree, either. I'm so madly in love with Yivo, I feel like a schoolgirl with a crush on Justin Timberlake, and then she moves into a tiny house on his head. We have giant rubies that taste like root beer. Sincerely, Fry. Letter for you, hyperlord Bender. Honeymoon's over, eh? Turns out your octopus girlfriend is a big nag with curlers in her tentacles, huh? if Bender will take you back.",
"Stupid electro-matter. That was my best trash can. Pain sensor overload. Misfile me under UFor euphoric. You get an infinite number of meat dishes, and a free refill on the soda. Eureka. Another elementary proof of the Goldbach conjecture. And that's what's wrong with heaven. It's boring. There's no sleaze. It time snu-snu. Me like snu-snu. Last one to mattress island is a rotten egg. Why were we so angry and jealous back in our universe? I don't know. It was all so childish.",
"I'm sorry you're not happy here, Leela. I'll call you an escalator. You'll always be my little purple pumpkin. You know, Yivo, I've loved and lost so many times that I was afraid. But I'm not anymore. I want to stay here, with you. What's happening? If robots can't go to heaven, heaven can come to us. All hands abaft. Army of the damned, prepare to board heaven. Take that, you scurvy Kraken. to despoil our human booty. Missed me again. Bender, stop destroying heaven. Shut up, doofy.",
"I'm rescuing you. Leave my living beings alone! Something you, a lifeless mechanism, will never understand. He's right, Bender. Please, take your little pink sword and go home. Seriously? pirate-themed attack for you. Wait a second. Let me see that sword. Fry, where did he get this electro-matter? Is it dry up here? How could you, Fry? Why do you think I asked you not to contact other universes? I didn't think. No, you didn't. You broke your promise and you broke my heart. I must leave now.",
"The nature of your universe is burning me, even worse than my gonorrhea. If I don't go home now, I'll shkluffocate. We'll make a fire and play Uno. Fry, stop. That's who we were, not who we are. My only consolation is that I did find one among the quadrillions who truly understands me. Colleen? Wait a second, are you and Yivo. That's right, Fry. Thank you for introducing us. what a narrow-minded prude I was before. Oh, great. So what am I supposed to do now? Find a girl from your own universe and live on top of her.",
"Maybe Yivo was right. for love closer to home. I don't know, Leela, you think maybe. You forgot me quick enough when you met Colleen. That's true. Fry. I'm Kif's Fonfon Ru. Are you? Well, then perhaps you misunderstood the meaning of the term. It means, One who doesn't sleep with my superior officer. That's the literal translation. Give the poor girl a break, Kif. It's not like she had a dictionary. She was butt naked, for God's sakes. So, Wernstrom, did you happen to notice those mighty cables Bender used on Yivo? Pure diamondium.",
"More like pure crap-crapium. No wonder Yivo got away. Captain on deck. Bender, why did you do it? We were all so happy. And we were in love. That wasn't love. What? How can you say that? Because Bender knows love. And love doesn't share itself with the world. Love is suspicious, love is needy, love is fearful, love is greedy. My friends, there is no great love without great jealousy. Twenty-four. I'm gonna get twenty-four. I'm gonna get twenty-fourth century on his ass Well done, Cubonius.",
"You decapitated the unicorn. All right. We search his tail pouch for treasure. Deep in the unicorn's rump sack, you find and a mysterious scrap of cloth bearing the unmistakable stench of dwarf urine. The same stench that was on the bed linens at the inn? The very same. What you doing, mini-meatbags? Underage gambling? Shame on you. Count me in. We're not gambling. We're playing Dungeons & Dragons. Right now, we're fighting for our lives in the lair of the dragon queen. Wrong, right now you're ass-deep in a folding chair.",
"Yes, but in my imagination I'm riding a golden Pegasus. Giddy up, Sparky! Am I the only one seeing him sitting here with peanut butter on his face? Bender, were you built without an imagination? What? Don't be stupid, of course not. It just hasn't descended yet. Fry, do I have an imagination? I don't know, Bender. Why do you ask? Were the other boys making fun of you? They said I couldn't imagine things. Well, you never know unless you try. Like, I didn't know so I gave it my best shot and voilŕ! Wait, that's not it.",
"There she blows. Warning, out of dark matter fuel. That's not a warning. A warning is supposed to come before something bad happens. Warning, engines will shut down in one second. That's more like it. This space neighborhood looks kind of sketchy. Rock'n' roll. That punk stole our hood ornament. Now no one will know We need dark matter and we need it fast. Fry, check Nibbler's litter box. Maybe he dropped a steamer. Aye, aye, Captain. Yes! I've never been so excited Well, maybe once.",
"There's gas in our ass. Can you believe the price of dark matter? It'd be cheaper to fill the tank with Nobel Prize winners' sperm. Total dark matter purchased, $632.14. Your Speedpass will now be charged. What shades of green is that? Puke? For your information it's called Electric Mucus. More like puke. Yeah, why don't you come a little closer so my boot can hear you? Calm down, Leela. You can vent tonight on your blog. What's the matters, you couldn't affords the LX package? You're making fun of our ship? Your ship is the most beat-up thing I've ever seen, and I've seen Mickey Rourke's head.",
"Yeah, she's a little worky, five-time winners at a demolition derby. That's five more times than we've won or even entered. Yup, and it's gonna be six winses after tonights. Dark matter costs have tripled, so we must reduce expenses. Therefore, we will no longer provide complimentary porno magazines in the lounge. Darn it. And no more wasting fuel. From now on I'll be keeping a tight hold on the keys to the ship, swallowing them before I go to bed and recovering them the next morning. Professor, it's 4:00.",
"I don't care what the Professor says. We're entering that demolition derby to prove our ship isn't a piece of junk. But won't that turn our ship into a piece of junk? Shut up, Zoidberg. He's right, Leela. But we have no choice. Rednecks insulted us. Don't let your temper get the better of. Rednecks! Using this magneto, I will now guide the keys up the thorax and out via the frontal face hole. That's the storage locker, the bolt, the other bolt, pay dirt! Greetings, sports fans.",
"Though whether this outpouring of inbreds can in fact be classified as a sport is a subject of no small scholarly debate. Well, wells, well, if it ain'ts Princess Pukerella and her pukey puke-mobile. Rich Little, here, as Howard Cosell. And now to grace us with its rendition of the national anthem, after their tragic matter transporter accident. We're in horrible pain. And we are underway. Yes! Now we're inflicting. Outstanding! Tonight we are witnessing a veritable clinic and that ludicrous hullabaloo known as demolition derby.",
"Way to kill the franchise, Bakula. Ladies and gentlemen, we are down to our final two ships. In the storied annals of demolition derby, today will surely be remembered, if only as the day upon which I was absorbed into that hideous conglomeration once known as the Dixie Chicks. Buckle your sphincters. That broad's insanes. But you're insansier, right? Nah, I guess nots. I've decideds to relax and enjoy life from now ons. And Planet Express takes the trophy. Now, I'll use the magnet to get the keys back in there.",
"What? You mean I cut a big hole in him for nothing? Don't worry, the Professor won't even remember My precious spaceship. My Ione source of joy in the cold December of my days. Come, friends. Let's take her for a spin Leela to Zoidberg. Execute Distraction Protocol Alpha. ZOIDBERG ON Roger that. Don't look at me. Yes, she's a wonderful ship, all right. As beautiful now as the day I got botched laser eye surgery. What's the fuel gauge doing on the. Great Godzilla's gonads! Who wasted precious fuel? Answer now or be punished.",
"All right, fine. I admit it. You will be punished. Your pole arm does double damage, and the gelatinous cube dies in horrible poverty. All right. Hooray. I proceed to cast a spell of darkness. Most ingenious. Bender? I cast a spell of darkness. Pretty imaginative, huh? No, you just did the same thing as me, but with a dumb noise. You're right. I'm great in every way except I have no imagination. All I ever wanted is to play this magical game and I can't. Yes, you can. You just have to lose yourself in the fantasy.",
"Okay. Here goes. Visor down. I did it! I imagined something. For 1. 3 milliseconds, I truly believed I was a noble robot in days of yonder. Way to go, Bender. What is thy character's name, good sir? I am Titanius Inglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood. Everybody out of the conference room. I am calling a conference. Everybody get in here. You wasted precious fuel just because you were insulted by some redneck yokel from beyond the stars? It was only half a ball. That's not the point.",
"Your temper is out of control. And to think I'd have never even known if it weren't for the lengthy and unsolicited tattling of Dr. Zoidberg. two rolls of Scotch tape. Thank you, Dr. Zoidberg. Hermes, incentivize that employee. As for you, Leela, I'm letting you off with a warning. Oh, thank you. A warning that will be administered by this 50,000-volt shock collar. Zoidberg, I'm gonna put my boot so far up your cloaca, you'll be. The collar will be triggered any time your thoughts turn to violence.",
"Profanity. Son of a. Or perversions of a sexual nature. Sorry, it's the only collar they had in stock at Office Depot. while you were there. That's a good one. NARRA Lmagine, if you will, an announcer you can barely understand. He refers to a. But you're not quite sure what he said. He seems to be eating something, or perhaps he's a little drunk. It's remotely possible that he just said something about The Scary Door. Firing, sir! It's all over. Our guns and bombs are useless against the aliens.",
"The saucers! Theys are crashing! NARRA In the end, it was not guns or bombs that defeated the aliens, but that humblest of all God's creatures, the Tyrannosaurus Rex. I can't believe TiVo suggested Come on, Hermes. Surely you have the authority to remove this damn collar. Alas, no. I got the key but not the authority. Well, who does have the authority? Only the staff doctor. You'll have to convince him that you have resolved your anger issues. I don't have any god.",
"Professor, something's bothering me. Well, you can always talk to me about anything, Fry. What's on your mind? Well, it's about my friend Bender. Show me on this anatomically correct doll exactly where he touched you. No, it's nothing like that. It's just that I am worried about him. He's being playing an awful lot of Dungeons & Dragons. Dungeons &. Good God! Hasn't he seen the Afterschool Special? You've got to talk to him, Fry. Make him quit now, before he completely loses his mind.",
"Just don't let him touch you down there. Well, here's your problem, right here. You've got a skull embedded in your head. You're absolutely right, Doctor. Can the collar come off now? Let me just peel your head a little and see if I can get that skull out. So, you tell me, little miss expert, why always with the temper? Calm down for once and think. Here, enjoy a relaxing spritz from my empathy bladder. What is it, already? What's the cause of your anger? I'm beginning to understand.",
"It all goes back to your parents. You have a resentment to study medicine, when all you ever wanted was to be a song-and-dance man. I was raised in an orphanarium. My parents are sewer mutants who I never even met until a few years ago. Then you've got to go to them and work this song-and-dance stuff out. Maybe have them cook me nice dinner. No scallions. I hate them. Amy, cancel my appointments. Stop calling me. Bender, please don't get mad, but I think you might be playing too much Dungeons & Dragons.",
"You're absolutely right, Fry. I almost went insane, but after this heart-to-heart talk, I'm off to slay the werewolf of Goblin Mountain. On guard, man-wench! Prepare to cross blades. You couldn't afford it, honey. Foolish leprechaun, I scoop your treasure in the name of the fancy men. of treasure on the living room rug. Foul dragon, meet thy doom. Would you like a napkin, Doctor? Thank you. Satisfied, Zoidberg? My relationship with my parents is fine. Now, hold on, Leela. Maybe this torture collar is good for you.",
"It'll control your temper. Men like a woman who's not always slamming their head in the car door. She's right. That's what first attracted me to your mother. So, Leela, I understand your friend here is a physician, and I'm not seeing a ring on his claw. Mom, he's a cockroach from outer space. Good, Leela, work that anger out. Excuse me a moment, I'm swarming with parasites. Hey, it's what's-his-name from the surface. Have you seen Bender? He's gone nuts. Prepare for a surprise attack.",
"Someone do something. I would, but. Ow! Take my collar off. I can't, I'm still eating. I cast upon thee a spell of fireball! Not the spork. Beholdeth, Titanius, I cast a freeze ray upon you. That's ridiculous. There's no such thing as a freeze ray. What, you mean a cone of coldness? No! No! Fancy men are defenseless against cone of coldness. I'm freezing. What? Bender, no. When will young people learn that Dungeons & Dragons won't make you cool? Relax, Fry. I'm a doctor.",
"I'm sure the robot will be just fine with a little help. Please, send in the patient. Yes, Doctor. So, Bender, I understand you're having trouble separating fantasy from reality. Says who? Was it the bugbear? Is he talking about me again? I understand. Commence therapy. Tell me about your feelings. Poor Bender. Says here to tell his friends he's at a spa. So what happened to Bender? Wow, there's a spa in the nut house? Friends, friends, stop everything. There's food in this shaker.",
"Enough already! Can you please remove this anger collar? Are you still angry? It also shocks you when you lie. Quiet, everyone. The network news is on. And if I, a 165-year-old man, don't watch it, who will? Thankfully, the amazing talking horse was rescued and safely returned to the meat department. Turning to the less stupid portion of our broadcast, fuel prices hit an all-time high today due to the ongoing dark matter shortage. Earlier, our own Morbo sat down with Mom, CEO of Mom's Friendly Multinational Energy Conglomerate.",
"Oh! Hello, Morbo the Annihilator, here, sitting down to a delightful tea in this fake living room set. Thank you for joining us, Mom. My pleasure, sugarplum. Mom, you control the world's only dark matter mine. Tell us, why are fuel prices so high? Oh! It's terrible, isn't it? Dark matter is just so rare nowadays, but we'll keep pinching loaf after loaf from the bowels of the earth, even if I lose money on every log. If you are losing money, how did you post record profits last quarter? You look thin, care for one of my famous pecan clusters? Morbo shouldn't.",
"It will go straight to Morbo's gargantuan forehead. Oh, what the heck? I guess I could destroy one or two of them. Do people care enough to drill for dark matter even in an Alaskan wildlife refuge? Greedy old hag, taste the wrath of my fuzzy slipper. Professor, why are you so hot and dusty over this dark matter shortage? I bet you'd like to know. I bet you'd like to know, indeed. Hello, Mother. How did the interview go? It made me want to puke my face off. Where's my Thigh Blaster? Right here, Mom.",
"Okay, thank you. Burn, you damn thighs. Burn! Mommy, are you upset'cause of the dark matter shortage? There is no shortage, you moronic ass-brain! There's not? But you said. Allow me to explain. Suppose this hand represents current reserves of dark matter and this hand represents consumer demand. I just bet you'd like to know why I'm so angry about this dark matter shortage. I bet very much you'd like to know. You're right, Professor. We would like to know. Really? I didn't think anyone was interested.",
"It all started 30-odd years ago. I was working in Mom's laboratories for the third time after twice before realizing and vowing never to work for her again. But somehow the rich, wrong stench of her boney charms kept calling me back. Don't stop, Professor. I'm getting aroused. Back in those days, dark matter was just a worthless inert curiosity, and I was smashing it in a particle accelerator, in an ill-conceived attempt to create a more durable harpsichord wax. But, as Deepak Chopra taught us, quantum physics means anything can happen at any time for no reason.",
"Also, eat plenty of oatmeal, and animals never had a war. Who's the real animals? And thus against all probabilities, it happened. Dang! I'm sure I don't need to explain that all dark matter in the universe is linked in the form of a single non-local meta-particle. Stop patronizing us. So, in one instant, I had transformed all dark matter everywhere into a new crystalline form… making it the most potent fuel since primitive man first ignited mastodon flatulence to heat his cave.",
"I'm intrigued, Hubert. You have my undivided attention. Shut up, you milk-sucking leeches! A new super fuel, eh? We're rich. Indeed, we are. I'm getting back together with my ex-husband. Wernstrom! You've been played, Farnsworth. Played like a cheap harpsichord. Walt, fire that employee Professor, maybe I can help you get even with Mom. I spend most of my time thinking about how to get revenge on a bad boss. I made a blinding powder. Thanks, but that won't be necessary because I have the ultimate weapon.",
"You see, in the instant the energy crystal was created, there also came into being an opposite crystal made of pure anti-backwards energy. If ever the two crystals should meet, their wave functions would collapse like Raymond Burr's trampoline, once again rendering all dark matter inert and useless as fuel. But then we'll have no fuel. But once we free society from dependence on Mom's dark matter, scientists will finally care enough to develop cleaner, alternative fuels. Scientists like you? No, not me.",
"I'm too busy developing makeup for dogs. That's where the money is. This is our chance to teach Mom a lesson. Come on! Let's take the anti-crystal and shove it up Mom's regular crystal. Fight the power! There's just one, small problem, and it's a big one. I hid the crystal and I can't remember where. Well, surely it's just a matter of waiting till you next move your bowels and then using a potato masher. Don't you think I already tried that? No. I'm afraid, the crystal is lost forever.",
"Nine? You did it. You outwitted the fungus. Who needs girls? Since you have all proven resistant to individualized hammer therapy, I now prescribe group therapy. Everything must be clean, very clean. He was a dirty dog. Dirty, dirty. Also, that boy, Elroy. Dirty, dirty. Who would like to share their feelings? I feel unappreciated at work. I can barely understand you. Change places. Well, well. Looks like old Roberto is the focus of attention now. Stop looking at me. Calm down, Roberto.",
"Tell us about your childhood. I was designed by a team of engineers attempting to build an insane robot. But it seems they failed. that we all have a serious problem. And if we ever wanna get out of here, the first step is to admit it. Amen. Good, Bender. That's right. There's a band of river trolls living in the moat, and they may have no intention of letting us out of this castle, unless we hand over the Golden Scepter of Zanthor. Say what? Dude's crazy.",
"I know not of this Bender. I am Titanius Inglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood. You are suffering a breakdown. Now stop. Hammer time. I'm in your seat. I forgot we had changed places. Change places. Good news, everyone! You perfected dog mascara? Far from it. a bunch of hookers. But what I have invented is a means of locating the missing crystal. When I push this button, the crystal will emit a high-frequency stink. Hurray! There. Now, with any luck I'll detect it with my smelling aid.",
"I just pray to all powerful Atheismo that we find it before Mom does. Do you smell the crystal, Professor? No, damn it! Just the alluring scent of Obsession for spaniels. Dude. Who whipped an egger? Yeah? Well, he who denied it, supplied it. Well, he who articulated it, particulated it. Well, he who refuted it, tooted it. Jesus craps. The anti-backwards crystal. Sorry? Relax, it's not your fault. I can't believe it still exists. Google the hell out of that skanker. Planet-sucking-Express? Of course.",
"How could I have been so dumb? With that crystal, Farnsworth could completely destroy my dark matter empire. I underestimated that sagging old bag of bones and gonads. Is that man bad? Very bad, Igner. And that's why I need you three to go steal the anti-crystal away from him. But be careful. You'll need all your stoogely cunning. Exterminators. Oh, great. Wall gophers? Toilet snails? No, I'm afraid you've got owls. Over there, see? Dump the bag, you nitwit. I was looking over there for a long time but I didn't see any.",
"Oh, there they are. Gross. Larry, get out the geigersniffer. I don't know, Walt. You're just gonna hit me with it. No. I'm going to hit you with this. Those three exterminators are hilarious. I don't think so. Me, neither. Now, Sex and the City, that's funny. After wandering aimlessly in the swamp, you suddenly. Wander aimlessly in the swamp. There it is. As you apparently didn't notice, we're trying to traverse the Quagmire of Slogdonia. I'm sorry, little boy. You see, we're owl exterminators.",
"We are owl. And what we have here is an owl egg that's about to hatch into an owl larva. So, if you don't mind, we'll just take this and. What are you, stupid? That's a dodecahedral crystal I found hidden in the downstairs walrus tank. And I wrote numbers on it'Cause I have the best handwriting. Do not. Do not. You win this round. What's going on here? We're owl exterminators. Then you won't have any problem exterminating this owl. My anti-backwards crystal. So it's you three.",
"I should have known Mom would send her brainless brood to do her dirty work. Walt, the leader among imbeciles. They resent that. Larry, the sniveling middle child. Sorry. Thank you. And you, Igner. The evil I could tolerate, We're owl exterminators. Just knowing we're in the same genus makes me embarrassed Now, get out and tell Mom thanks for the crystal. Thanks for the crystal. There. The repairs are complete. Let's go, already. We've got to infiltrate Mom's dark matter mine, now.",
"How do you start this thing? Good lord, woman. Can you move any slower? Rake up some dark matter and top off the tank. Well, there isn't any dark matter. Nibbler hasn't pooped at all. And he ate a whole family of koalas last night. Nibbler! Nibbler! I'm not interested in the whereabouts of your cutesy-fruitsy space rat. The only thing that matters right now is this crystal. And be careful with that crystal. Death to ogres! Even relaxation therapy has failed. Diagnosis, insanity. Nurse, schedule a robotomy for Bender.",
"Yes, Doctor. I'll get the tools from the shed. It's a very painful procedure. So until then, just try to relax. What are you laughing at? Your laugh. It's just so infectious. So's herpes. Now, shut up! You and Walt, lead the killbots to the surface and blow Farnsworth out of the sky. What about Igner? That hairless ape? I swear. When he came out, I flipped a coin whether to keep him or the after-birth. Yes, Mother. You told that story at his graduation. I'm afraid he can't be trusted on this mission.",
"You see, there is a terrible secret about Igner I've never told anyone. And here it is. Continue returning fire. I don't know. I can't hear a thing. Hey, what's everybody talking about? Oh, God. I cannot believe this is the best plan I could come up with. We weren't actually in the ship. Okay, team, these red-hot, razor-sharp fans are the only safe way into the mine. Ladies first. by the skin of my pants. Maintenance shaft 7 serving. Shut your mouth. I'm just talking about the shaft.",
"Jeez. Doesn't that shock collar hurt? Actually, feels kind of good. I guess I'm starting to associate it with the pleasure of beating people up. We shot them down, Mother. The intruders never even got to Sector 1. Intruders in Sector 15. Intruders in Sector 15. Sometimes I don't know why I even bother to slap you. MOM ON All killbots to Sector 15. There are so many killbots behind us, I can't count them all. Three, I think. We're trapped. The main pit must be in here.",
"I'm detecting vast quantities of dark matter. Step aside turkey-neck. I think I know the code. We're in. We're in the heart of the mine. The very source of all Mom's wealth and. My God! This isn't a crap mine. It's a crap farm. Is there really so much of a distinction? I mean. Leela, it's me, Nibbler. Oh, my God, you look horrible, Nibbler. I think I'm going to vomit. Nibbler is over there. Oh, sorry. Nibbler. Oh, sorry. Nibbler. Oh, my poor little snuzzy-wuzzams.",
"Are they treating you okay? No, they are force-feeding us so we poop more dark matter. It's horrible. Those are good. Help us, for God's sakes! Nibbler made a bo-bo. Yes, but not on my terms. I will not be treated like. Hey, wait, aren't you amazed I can speak? Well, actually, no. You forgot to blank our memories after you spoke last time. You mean you've known I was sentient? Then why did you let me eat Friskies and make bo-bo in a litter box? Well, you're cuter that way. So what happened? How did Mom capture all you Nibblonians? It all began 36 years ago.",
"Now! On the planet Virgon 6. It was a veritable Eden, brimming with unique and irreplaceable species. Most of which were delicious. I was supreme fuzzler of a Nibblonian scientific outpost. It was paradise, until they came. One of your duke ships struck dark matter, little realizing it was not a natural deposit, but rather centuries of Nibblonian fecal material. Wow, the big fecal enchilada. Anyone else hungry? The duke contracted a ruthless businesswoman to spearhead the mining operation.",
"The very same. Can I also guess Mom? To reduce cost she started a new enterprise, Mom's Friendly Robots, to build robot slaves. Remember this was back in the days before Robot Lincoln. Faster, faster! I'm going exactly Eventually, the planet was mined down to a hollow shell and my people were forced to evacuate. Alas, I had eaten a day-old swinosaur for lunch. And while doing some evacuating of my own, I was left behind. So, that's where it comes from. We may have a whole new source of dark matter on our hands.",
"As it turned out, I was the lucky one. Unbeknownst to me, Mom captured my colleagues and enslaved them here in this crap farm. There's nothing to do but eat and crap, eat and crap. It's like visiting my parents. As for me, I emerged from behind the bush of many uses to find I had been left behind. Hello, there. Startled, my cuteness reflex kicked in. I'll call him Nibbler. A silly name for a high-ranking fuzzler. But, hey, I was glad to be rescued. But then, how did you end up here with the others? I was kidnapped yesterday by Mom's vile sons, in their moronic disguises.",
"I was an owl exterminator. Do you have the crysal? It's pronounced crystal,you lump. Go, run fast. Did you see anyone? Yes, you. You're the only one here. If I'm the only one here, then how could I see anyone? He's got a point, Walt. So does my knee. This wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the chickens. Don't worry, those clamps are for my own protection. Do you know where you are, Bender? Sure do, I'm in the magical land of Cornwood, frolicking with wenches. Close, you're in the loony bin for a robotomy.",
"I will begin by drilling through the eye to access the frontal processor. Can't you just use the access panel? Either way is fine. Does anyone else smell burning dragon beak? Wherever you are, Farnsworth, my boys will find you. They've eluded us, Mother. But rest assured, we've already slapped each other, so there's no need to. You'll thank me some day when you are slapping your own kids. I know Farnsworth's game. He is going to try to poke his clammy old crystal at my hot fiery crystal.",
"If the crystals get within six inches of each other. Wham! All my dark matter will be worthless. Keep going, Professor. I'll take care of the ditz brothers. Oh, for crying out. Oh, the freaking battery's dead. Walt, where's the charger? In the hardware drawer, Mother. Damn tangled mess of wires. We're almost there. The crystals are beginning to engorge. I can't quite reach. Fry, grab onto my easy-fit waistband. Just a few more inches. Come on, really wedgie it on in there.",
"So, that's why they call me the Catman. Nobody move. I've found the charger. Hang on. I'm on it. Okay, there! Save us, Catman. It's over, Hubert. Give me the anti-backwards crystal. Never! Oh, bravo. You're in a crap-harvesting factory, genius. Walt! Larry! Start harvesting. I will now delicately jerk out your imagination, severing fantasy's grip on your nerd-circuit. Cornwood! Illogical. Illogical. Computational overload. But, Doctor, I love you. Oh, what now? This is crazy.",
"Ow! Yeah, I think so. Wait a second. Is there something different about your hooves? Oh, Lord. I'm half-horse and half-naked. Where the hell are we, hell? Bender? I know not of this Bender. I'm Titanius Inglesmith. Welcome to Cornwood! Wretched peasants, put aside your cares and feast on the succulent flesh of the roast munchkin! Care for a slice of scroto? That's his name, right?'Tis also that, sir. We're honored this eve by a visit from my friends of old, Frydo and Legola. So let the dwarves do their gay dance and let the gnomes play their sissy piccolos.",
"Dance! Dance, you little freaks. Faster. Faster! My ankle! To the kitchen with him! Wait! Wait! Wait! I do impressions. Don't let him get too crispy. Lord Inglesmith. You have ridden hard, noble squire. May I offer you a horn of ale and a shank of dwarf?'Tis dire news, sire. Dark riders approach. You shall be handsomely rewarded, sir knight. We ride at once! Frydo! Saddle up that trusty steed. What's happening? And why am I enjoying it so much? Damn thee, Ignus. Well, now I say follow this! The die of power! He's rolling it.",
"Oh, no! DISEMBODIED Seven. Banish foes? Cool. I got to say, I had no idea the die of power was so powerful. Did you have any idea of. I can't believe I'm saying this, but that was really exciting. I've never felt so alive. What else can we slay? Is that a hobbit over there? No, that's a hobo and a rabbit. But they're making a hobbit. Thank God, an outhouse. I can't hold it in much longer. And by it, I mean my entrails. Hush! This be no outhouse, but the lair of the great wizard Grayfarn.",
"'Tis I, Titanius. Just a moment. Methinks the wizard be casting a powerful spell, indeed. Come in! Come in!'Tis a powerful object in both our worlds. If you failed to destroy it in yours, perhaps you were brought here that you might have a second chance. So, this land is real? Oh, dreadfully real. If you die here, you'll really be dead. But instead of science, we believe in crazy hocus-pocus. It's like Kansas. Cornwood's troubles began hundreds or perhaps millions of years ago. Deep in the Geysers of Gygax, Momon herself injection-molded the dice of power from the living plastic.",
"Damn, these are hot. In our universe she's called Mom. In your universe, are you taught not to interrupt? Evidently not. Anyway, Momon spawned three rotten sons, whom you've already had the displeasure of meeting. Waltazar, Larius, and the dumbest of all, the halfwit Ignus, bastard son of Momon and the brainless He-demon. Curse you, Momon, queen of all that is evil and not very good in bed. And I'm not just saying that Yes, I was once her consort. I was blinded by love, and later, scorpion venom.",
"I'm blind! But Momon has one weakness. She put too much of her power into this. The generalissimo of dice. Yeah? Well, bite my shiny metal face. Don't be foolish, Titanius. If you had paid attention in freshman alchemy, instead of frequenting the bawdyhouse, you'd know there's only one way to destroy it. In the boiling plastic from which it was molded. Like that machine that makes wax lions at the zoo. We must infiltrate the Geysers of Gygax, the impenetrable stronghold of Momon. No, Titanius.",
"For we maintain one advantage, the element of surprise. Verily, our quest has begun. Stop right there. Hermes? He's a centaur like me. I am Hermaphrodite, most beautiful of centaurs. Gaze upon me and weep at my loveliness. Very well. Loveliest of centaurs, we seek to end Momon's reign of evil. Have you stout fighters at your command? One thousand archers of truest aim. Fire. Hey guys, I forgot I had this pumpkin. I knew it. My people are mighty warriors. Our enemies will be like Swiss cheese with blood coming out of the holes.",
"We centaurs are creatures of peace. Oh, Lord. Violence is never justified. We shall not join your quest. And furthermore, if mayhem be your intent, you may not cross our lands. Or what? Or. We're not there, we're here. I mean, here. Thank you, kindly, Treedledum. Okey-doke. Anything else I can do? You know who I'm gonna miss? That tree guy. Bad news, fancy men. Momon's guards stand watch at the pass.'Tis as if she somehow anticipated us. And so our quest comes to an end. I only regret not giving up sooner.",
"Fret not, Titanius. For we still have one hope, the Cave of Hopelessness. Let me know how that turns out. Halt. Are you on the list? I'm not seeing you on the list. I'll split this doofus in half. Yeah. My cousin's in the band. The band of merry men. Please, we were already in there. I just need to go back for my coat. I am Gynecaladriel, queen of the water nymphos. All right. I'll split this doofus in half. Stand aside, and I will use my powers to overwhelm the guard. Behold, the deed is done.",
"Mr. Wizard, why is this place called the Cave of Hopelessness? Oh, fear not, lad.'Tis named for its discoverer, Reginald Hopelessness… the first man to be eaten alive by the Tunneling Horror. What's that? The Tunneling Horror? No, it's morks. Mork. Hey, listen. Nanu, nanu. Shazbot. Oh, God, no. They're so aggravating. Oh, fantastic. Nanu, nanu. Reality, what a concept. Fantastic. Mindy, Mindy, Mindy. Oh, fantastic. Oh, fantastic. Oh, wonderful. if we just don't laugh at it.",
"It doesn't. Nanu, nanu. Well, at least we didn't have to face the tunneling whatchimacallit. Enough already with the banging and the swashbuckling. Oh, I'm gonna enjoy killing you. Watch where you're shooting that thing. Again? What, am I talking to myself over here? Okay. Now, I'm getting a little mad even. I'll kill you and eat your heart, you abomination. Don't make me laugh. The very idea that removing only one of my two hearts could. Hey, what are you doing down there? Leela, it's over.",
"You killed him enough. I'm not taking any chances with the Tunneling Horror. What? I'm not the Tunneling Horror. Always with the tunneling. Anyway, I'm dead. So, you're just an innocent monster. Oh, God. What have I done? Oh! There he goes again. The Tunneling Horror! Grayfarn, what do we do? Why aren't you killing it, Leela? You love killing. No, no more killing. Oh! So, suddenly, Miss Goody Four-shoes over here doesn't kill anymore. She killed me not five minutes ago. What am I? Chopped liver? Stop chopping my liver.",
"You're on your own. I refuse to hurt another living thing. All right. I may be weak and I may be small, but I don't see how I can possibly destroy that monster. huck whatever's in my pockets at him. At least I can say I tried. Any time now. The die of power. I forgot to remember to roll it. DISEMBODIED Three. Grow? I don't see anything growing. Everything is getting smaller. Wait a second. I'm big! In your face, everyone from middle school. Especially, Jeremy. Wow, that was intense.",
"You guys got to try the die of power. Hands off the dodecalicious. Beware, Frydo. Don't be seduced. Hang on a second. Resist the allure of the die. For to defeat Momon, we must melt it in the super bombastic, bubbling plastic from whence it came. For to defeat Momon, we must melt it in the super bombastic, bubbling plastic from whence it came. I send you to kill them and they're not even maimed? for sending boys to do a mom's job. Sorry, Mom. Sorry doesn't put heads on my table. You're up.",
"I like this part but I don't like. You are an able opponent, Hermaphrodite. But hear me well when I posit that we must abhor violence in all its forms. I offer a dissenting opinion. For abhorring violence is itself an act of violence and, therefore, to be abhorred. All bow before mighty Hermaphrodite. Don't hurt me. I'm not here to hurt you. Or anything ever again. the centaurs' ways of wimpiness. What do you offer in return? of such sweet things to say Don't know what you're doing to me But you're doing to me what I want you to of that godforsaken cave.",
"Back through the cave? We're close now, my friends. So close, I can practically feel the heat of the fiery molten plastic. You're standing in the fire. Alas, our path is blocked by Momon's army of evil. As well as her navy of moral dubiousness. Wait a second. raise an army of our own. We're but an hour's ride from Wipe Castle. Of course. Wipe Castle. And while we're there, we can get some of those greasy little dwarf burgers. You can eat like eight of them without gaining any weight, because of all the diarrhea.",
"Sleep deep, fair snoozles. At dawn, we ride for Wipe Castle. Quiet, Frydo. We've got them now. Send all our forces against Wipe Castle. Right away, Mother. I'll just leave a small contingent behind in case. I said, everything. Peaches! I'm in the tub. Waltazar, you and Larius shall lead the assault. What about Ignus? I'm afraid he can't be trusted on this mission. You see, there is a terrible secret about Ignus I've never told anyone. And here it is. Oh, put a towel on, for crap's sake.",
"They all wants it. They wants the dodecalicious. you want to defend a magic artifact, and I mean, defend it good, then what you need is a top-quality knife. Me is listening. The Eviscerator is one of the finest, if not the finest, tactical folder on the market today. We're talking 440 stainless, quick release and. I don't believe this. Is this a stag horn handle at this price? It is, yeah. It's a stag horn. At this price? You have got to be kidding me. That's got to be some kind of mistake, right there.",
"I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, that can't be stag horn. It's got to be the cheaper manticore horn. But, I've got the specs right here and I'll tell you what, this is the real deal. Unbelievable. It is unbelievable. That's exactly what it is. I mean, this is. I have no words to describe this deal. Honestly, have you ever seen stag horn at this price? No, no, I don't believe I ever have. You know what, we're gonna have to put a clock on this deal, folks. Two minutes.",
"Can I get a clock at two minutes up there? Two minutes at most. Honestly, I'd be surprised if they last that long. Oh, I'd be very surprised, shocked really. Now, I know the lines are busy, people, but keep dialing in if you want a truly exceptional knife to slice up your friends in their sleep. He tried to murder me. He tried. Oh, cool. Is that the stag horn? Alas, Frydo's weakness was no match for the die's strength. We can only hope he forges on alone to the Geysers. I can hope my ass is made of ice-cream but that don't make me a hot fudge sundae.",
"As for us, we must press on to Wipe Castle, though the journey be long and I fear I may not live to see it. There it is! They's following us's. You know, you talk like that, it's gonna cost you points at a job interview. What does it wants? First of all, I resent being called it. I prefer jerkhole or simply. Second, I thought I could help you destroy the die, maybe. The die is tearing me apart. No, it's not. We're having a nice time. S'all right? S'all right. Now, before your audience with the king, there's a shocking fact you best know about him.",
"Enough blabbety-blab! Open the doors. We bring ill tidings, o fanciest of men. Momon's reach nears the die of power. And should she obtain it, she will then have the entire basic set. Rivers will run red with blood and yellow with urine. And a dog will be seen eating cat food in the land. Oh, great king, your army is the last hope of Cornwood. Let us join forces before the light of good is extinguished forever. You calling me crazy? Just'cause I've got a hotel in my foot don't make me a.",
"Pardon? Stop laughing at me, fried avocado. Moving along then, as the only nobleman present who's not. I hereby place myself in command of the royal army. What royal army would that be? King went insane and declared war on the scallops. Tied his army to a boulder and pushed them into the sea. They never returned. Oh, well. There'll be no epic battle today. Methinks we be boned. Where's their army? Maybe they didn't hear the horn. Blow it again. Man, I'll show that cat how to blow.",
"All right. On three. One, two, three. Oil in the murder hole. What are they pouring through the murder hole? Hot oil? Yeah, I think it might be hot oil. I knew it. I was right, Walt. It's hot oil. What the. You're not made of Tuesday. My sanity. It's back. At last, I can live the life I always. You're going onto sainthood. What does it mean? It is as we feared. Evil will soon triumph over good. Your friends face certain death. Followed by a disrespectful marionette show performed with their corpses.",
"No! We've got to do something. We've taken out a sternly worded ad in tomorrow's Cornwood Times. What a load of man-horse manure. Well, Legola, if you have a better idea, perhaps you'd like to challenge me to I'm too exhausted. I can't go on. I'm here for you, my friend. I'll drag you onward. Even to my last ounce of strength. Grab onto my testicles. You know, I think maybe I can walk after all. That's not Wipe Castle. The dodeca-call is coming from inside the house.",
"What are you waiting for, Frydo? Throw it already in the boiling plastic. Me's enjoys owning it. Stop talking like that. It gives me anxiety. So, it's all come down to this. A dungeon and dragons. I didn't see it coming. Eat the wizard, Eat the robot's shiny butt we'll be remembered in song. Wait a second. I have an idea. I surrender. Here, eat my friends. Just give me one more second Well, that worked out pretty good, eh, fellows? Prepare to fire again, brave cowards.",
"I still say, I won the debate. Fire. How can I ever repay you? Frydo is fighting for his life. The fate of Cornwood is in our hands. Quickly, to the Geysers. Can it wait a couple of minutes? Yes. Yes, it can. You are no match for my dragon style. I guess you are a match for my dragon style. Tell me, Frydo, are you aware that a dragon's one weakness is its soft underbelly? Get my friend out of your mouth. It is all over, Momon. We'll soon be down there defeating you. And it's all thanks to the existence of this fragile staircase.",
"Quick. Get on the magic bug. It's not a magic bug, you dope. It's a magic arachnid. Can't you count the legs? Six, seven, eight. Not six, eight. My underbelly. My one weakness. I got it. Now I can throw it in the hot thing over there and be the hero. On the other hand, infinite power might be nice. Please, I'm trying to help you. Then why are you hitting me with a stick? How stupid are you that you think that's helping? Mommy never told you about my father. She said he was a foul He-demon.",
"You are my father. Search your feelings. You know it to be true. No, no! Yeah. I heard Mommy say so. I am the dungeon master. I know all and see. Game over. What happened? we're out of that weird, crazy world and back in our regular crazy world. have some kind of freaky dream or was it ghosts? Neither, Fry. It was science.

"Yes! Four aces! Read'em and weep, and then tell me what they are. Two kings. And with three on the board, that gives Bender five kings. I don't believe it. Bender has just been dealt the King of Beers, a coaster from the bar that somehow got mixed into the deck. But it still counts! Bender win the Championship! That's some good money. You did it, Bender. You're the greatest. Tell me something I don't know, sweetass. We'll be in Space Tahiti before the Donbot knows what hit him.",
"Okay, we finished digging this shallow grave. Can we go now? Poor Bender left me one last voicemail before the Robot Mafia buried him in the desert. Fry, old friend, before I die, I just wanted to say. Hang on, I'm getting another call. Hello? Line up, people! Everyone take a shovel and one sixth of the planet. We'll meet back here in 50 years, our bodies broken and our lives wasted. And you say these are free shovels? Bender! I thought the Nah, they just shot us and buried us a few times as a warning.",
"Bender was so brave. He never stopped making out with me the whole time they were shooting us. I sure didn't. I gotta get back to my husband, baby. Will I see you tonight? Probably not. It's a 14-footer with a clown hazard. What club you recommend, Baggy? As on every hole, I suggest the putter. Your golf club sure is classy, Mr. Wong. Naked statue classy. It is very nice. I just wish Amy and I didn't have to wear these sexist badges on our melons. We're lucky even to play as guests, Leela.",
"Dad's club has a very strict No girls allowedpolicy. That doesn't seem fair. It really is. Everybody knows women don't have the focus to play miniature golf at a professional level. I think that my ball. Great putt, Dad. Okay, we're done. Mr. Wong, how do you keep this place so green in the middle of the desert? Doesn't that waste a lot of water? Nah, we got plenty water, pumped directly from flamingo lake. They'll be fine. Oh, yeah, I love miniature golf. Love everything about it, except how damn miniature it is.",
"That's why I'm building the universe's biggest miniature golf course. This the first tee. Where's the hole? On Pluto's moon, Hydra. It's a six-billion-mile par-two. Tough shot, even for a man. Around the sun. Bank off Jupiter. And right into the. I'll be right back. It dropped in! Put me down for a two. Keep in mind, that just the first hole. For full course, we gonna bulldoze this entire arm of the Milky Way. What? You're gonna wipe out 10 % of the galaxy for a stupid golf course? First of all, it 12 %.",
"Second, yes, you betcha. But you have no idea what life forms might be evolving out there. I'm hiring an impartial scientist to perform an environmental survey. That's him in the money shower. Delivery boy's log. Having fallen asleep on what I thought was the toilet, I awoke to find the environmental survey in progress. Status reports, Science Officer. Zilcho. No sign of life or intelligence. Just like Fry on a date. Okay, so we haven't found any life yet. I still don't see why you men can't be happy with regular-sized miniature golf.",
"Leela, evolution has programmed our fabulous male brains to take anything anybody else thinks is important and make it bigger. Have you seen my new 301-inch TV? Hypnotoad is brought to you by the MagnaPhallix 302-inch TV. It's bigger! Captain, I'm detecting life on the spock-o-scope! It's amazing. It's like a textbook on evolution. Except in Kansas. But isn't Mr. Wong building the 18th hole here? And the golf pants museum? Indeed so. This whole area will be incinerated when he implodes that sun there into a black hole.",
"That beautiful violet star? It's so you can't keep your ball at the end of the game. Well, there won't be any imploding once they read our environmental review. Right, Professor? There's no scientific consensus that life is important. Approved for demolition. It's you and me, ponytail. We're here, Mr. President. Let's play some mini-golf. Now, just give it a light tap, Agnew. No, no, no, just a light. Now for a triple clam dip, with a double. Tough luck, Agnew. Looks like you and Wong owe me a Charleston Chew.",
"Shut up and hear our wisdom. Shut up and hear our wisdom. Shut up and hear our wisdom! Save the ecosystem! What gives, Wong? You said no chicks allowed. We are the Greenorita Eco-Feminist Collective, and we will not let you. What was it again? We will not let you implode the violet dwarf star at galactic coordinates 167. 84, 58. 03, mark 948. Already approved, you cackling hens. So get out, or I'll have vice-president Agnew's headless body throw you out. I'd like to see him try.",
"Me, too. Should look funny. Sic'em, Agnew. Runaway golf cart! Look out, Agnew! remains of Agnew. Arrest them! All feministas she-vacuate the premises. I mean femises. My fellow Earthicans, these eco-crooks will face the maximum sentence. For killing a headless torso, that's six weeks. Well, this is embarrassing. Here I've been blabbing on for years about killing all humans, and who actually does something about it? Some chick. Leela's not a killer, and she's not some chick.",
"And don't tell her I called her a chick, or she'll kill me. Everyone stay absolutely quiet! That thing's on. Turn it off! Oh, sorry. How do you turn it off? There. Did that do it? Here's the button here. And I think I. Now I got it. Let me give you a hand. I never meant for our protest to have any effect. Now what do we do? Maybe we should just surrender and serve our six weeks in jail. other's toenails and make shivs. That's crazy. We've done nothing wrong, other than killing and dismembering the vice-president.",
"We need to make a choice, sisters. We can either keep pestering criminals like Leo Wong with silly slogans. Actually, I meant that to be the less preferable alternative. We can either chant slogans or we can take action. What was the first choice again? I choose to save the environment by sabotaging Leo Wong's golf course. Could we still use our bullhorns? Bullhorns are a core principle of eco-feminism. Then I'm in. Girls be talkin' Like they all rah, rah Who's ready to kick some sweaty man-butt? I've got my pointy man-kicking shoes on.",
"Those are cute. Aren't they? I got them at Nine West. Simmer down, warriors. Full power to the vagyroscope! Those dirty rings. I tried soaking them out, even blasting them out. Are you sure about this? It would be better for propaganda if we weren't using refined sugar. It's okay. The potato we're shoving in the tailpipe is organic. And potatoes. Now, unfortunately, the media is going to put a negative spin on this, like when we killed that guy, so to win public support, we'll need a lovable mascot.",
"Squirm all you want, you nasty dumpling. One less species for the universe, one more breakfast for. Zoidberg? Me saving things the leech. Not the eating of it. Zoidberg, I'm very surprised I know. I miss you so much, Leela, even more than when you were here. I miss you, too, Fry. And you probably think what I'm doing is wrong. But it's something I really care about. You don't have to explain, Leela. You're you. That's all I need to know. I'll miss her, too, buddy. Dibs on her iPod.",
"Dibs on. Hey, Fry! Long time, man. Hey, Hutch! What have you been up to? Searching the dumpsters, protecting my thoughts with tin foil, peeing myself. So, what brings you to Earth? It's top secret. Hey, take off your helmet and I'll think it to you. Okay. Here goes. Where are you? And me? The Great Hall of the Ancient Legion of Madfellows. Welcome, bro. Welcome, bro. Welcome, bro. Sorry I bashed your head in, buddy, but I had to. universe depends on you. The Grand Curator will tell you more.",
"Hey, man. So dig this, Fry. Our commune has been monitoring the universe's life energy for, like, a really long time, and we're grokking some super weird junk. I don't mean to be rude, but it's kind of hard to take you seriously when you say junk like grokand junk. What about commune? Especially commune. Come on, it's the fate of the universe, puff it up a little. your ancient order is sensing deep upheaval in the cosmic life energy field. Okay. I'll try. So, like, a really, really long time ago.",
"Eons ago! Eons ago, the life force we call Chee permeated the universe. The Green Chee generated a great upwelling of life across the cosmos. But then, for reasons unknown. Ooh. Reasons unknown. Now that's the sort of hook that grabs the attention of me, the viewer. For reasons unknown… the Chee began to recede, and the diversity of life began to wither. The life forms we know today are but a fraction of a fraction of the magnificence that once existed. But a bunch of dudes, right, they totally passed this far-out knowledge down through the ages.",
"Silence, Hutch! You shall learn more in time, Fry. But for now, let's just say we have enemies, enemies who can read minds, except yours. Cool. I can't wait to tell Leela. No! If you tell anyone, then their thoughts could be read, and our enemies would know of our existence. For the sake of those you love, you must keep this secret. Do you foot-swear? Okay. I foot-swear. coming of the green age, you must stop this man. I know him. Leo Wong. I work with his daughter. You must gain Wong's confidence, infiltrate his organization and prevent him from destroying the violet dwarf.",
"Looking for a job, eh? Yes, sir. Nothing fancy. I'm willing to start at the bottom and infiltrate my way up. Sorry, no openings right now. What I need is security guard to keep nutcases out of my office. I'm good at keeping nutcases. I said no way. Security guard gotta be tough. This idiot don't look like he could handle those feministas. I look like an idiot who can handle those feministas. He'll have to do better than that. I'll have to do better than that. Hmm. You and I think a lot alike.",
"You really think you can stand up to those eco-freakos? Sir, with me around, they'll be the least of your worries. Stand by, men. And manly aliens. Prepare to test fire King Kong hole. It workses. Good job, men. And manly aliens. Construction of King Kong hole complete. Always King Kong, never Queen Quong. What are those, hooks? Get out of heres, you hookers. This is my turfs. You go, gorilla! Our top story. The string of eco-vandalism that began with a harmless vice-presidential killing has spread across the galaxy.",
"Leo, you're a parasite on the universe, and parasites must be destroyed. this parasite as our mascot. I know it's a little confusing. The point is, even this vicious leech has a right to exist, because it's a part of nature. And that's why a vicious leech like Leo Wong must be exterminated. Again, confusing. We call on women everywhere to join our struggle against eco-chauvinist Leo Wong. We especially need good communique writers. Feministas unite! In other news. Feministas unite! Feministas unite! Incredible.",
"Absolutely incredible. You're telling me this TiVo machine can pause and rewind live TV? These crazy broads gonna ruin me, Nixon. Send the army or something. Something big that shoots. Sir, I don't care if you are my biggest contributor. Our armed forces do not serve your private business interests. Sorry, I. I'm just yanking your chain, Leo. I'm on it like boring on Gerry Ford. Zapp Brannigan purporting for duty. For the love of God, Kif, less piccolo, more fife. Report, Brannigan.",
"Mr. President, I failed to identify these curvaceous banditas despite hours of staring at their dossiers. stroked myself upon good luck, for a patriot of the highest order has volunteered to lead us to them. These eco-feminists are ruthless criminals who'll stop at nothing to save the environment. I don't see how a bending unit can catch them. Not just any bending unit, Presidente. I happen to be brilliant, fearless and short on cash. Short on cash. Slush him, Kroker. Bender here has identified the femdito commander as my ex-lover, Turanga Leela, whom I once made love at.",
"And he's willing to fink her out for a few simoleons? It's not about the money, Nixon, though I'd like much more. It's'cause Leela's a threat. A threat to my reputation. She's committed 30 felonies in 12 star systems. If no one stops her, she'll break my record for longest rap sheet. Bender, and I respect it. Now, I could find Leela, but you'll need to authorize a wiretap. As many as you like. I only need one. Question. If you don't know where Leela is, how can you wiretap her? I'm not wiretapping her, Greensleeves.",
"You see, like all women, Leela has one weakness. Hello, weakness! Hey, Bender, check it out. I'm Leo Wong's new security guard. I got an ID badge and a flashlight, and I ordered this mustache. Neat. Say, speaking of whatever the hell you just said, I need to make a cell phone telephone call. Can borrow your cell phone telephone? Okay, but don't restart my Tetris. I was finally about to get one of those pieces that looks like a backwards L. Okay, superstud. Looking good, security.",
"No feministas getting past you. No, sir. Not on my Fry, I can't believe you're working with my dad against Leela. How can you claim to be her friend and still want her in jail? It's a tightrope walk, I won't deny it. It takes the kind of multi-sided thinking your dad's so brilliant at. You mean being two-faced? Don't mind cranky-pants here. She been cranky ever since she was a fat little girl. Can I be brutally honest, Fry? I always wanted a son. That hurt, but I can take it. I knew you wanted a son! Why do you think I became a miniature golf champion? Why do you think I wear To hide your Now, sir, in fairness, Amy's butt is actually pretty hot.",
"What is it with you men? Why does everything revolve around my butt?'Cause it's so big and massive. Sorry. Why don't you just adopt Fry and make him the son you never had? That'll replace the daughter you don't have anymore! She just hungry. Here you go, Fry. Thanks. Oh! FYI, I dropped that Tetris piece in the wrong place and ended the game. Great! Now Amy's gonna tell Leela I'm a jerk. If only I could explain I'm on a secret mission against evil. What's going on in there? A scary noise? Hey, you're one of Leela's feministas.",
"Save the environment! Wo-mandate Leo's retirement!That's terrible writing! Stop making your point so ineffectively! Take your mands off of me! I'm on your side. Don't shush me. Please, can you take Just say her sweet goofbag is working to save the violet dwarf star, just like she is. Very well, I'll fem-municate your man-formation. Just tell her. Well, this is it, old friends. Planet Express is done for, what with our delivery crew missing and the abysmal sales of Tickle Me Bender.",
"Quit touching my junk, pervert! Hold out your hands and I'll remove your career chips. I hate to see it come to an end. When will it end? Shouldn't you get that, Professor? Professor, old buddy, I'm gonna blow up the violet dwarf star. So I need you deliver billion-mile security fence to keep out protesters. Dirty business. Lot of money. You corrupt enough? Damn skippy! Good news, crybabies! We're back in business. Sweet kookaburra of Edinburgh, Professor. You sure you know how to fly this thing? I invented it, didn't I? You wouldn't ask Thomas Edison whether he knew how to use a sexmatron.",
"The feministas, probably. Halt! What are you doing in this parallelogram of space? We're delivering a fence to keep you ladies in your place. Labarbara? That's right, husband. From now on, you make your own Manwiches. Under the articles of the confemiracy, we hereby wo-mandeer this ship. Oh, no, you don't. It's three against three. That was the greatest play I ever saw. We installed your fence, Leo Wong. Should we shout a clever slogan? You mean something like, The best defense is a good fence?Yeah, something like that, only funny.",
"Six, seven, eight One, two, three Turn the key My dirty, shifty friend? Hey, Fry, long time. Legion of Madfellows, man. Why'd you bonk me, you idiot? And where are we? This doesn't look like your regular dumpster. All in good time! I guess now is a good time. We are on Mars, in a forgotten cavern abandoned by the native Martians a million years ago. Actually, it was five years ago. I remember'cause they washed my socks. You have done well, Fry. You have ingratiated yourself with Leo Wong.",
"That concludes the audio-visual portion of our head-clonk and lecture. Wait, what happened to the snakes and the frogs? I need to know! The frogs, or possibly the snakes, evolved into vicious killing machines, honed by the merciless forces of natural selection and intelligent design. We call these the Dark Ones! These evil creatures preyed on all life, driving species after species to extinction. Meanwhile, however, the second species evolved to fend off the Dark Ones, befriending and protecting all other living things.",
"Even Celine Dion? Probably. We call these noble beings the Encyclopods, because their DNA incorporates the DNA of every endangered species they encountered, so they can recreate them if they go extinct. Just as a pillow, a wig and a corncob pipe can be used to recreate my old girlfriend! Bingo. Meanwhile, at the Honeybun Hideout. There! Now you know how it feels to be locked up in a go-go cage. What the hell are you talking about? Shut your man-hole. I feel dirty. Are you sure Fry is working for your father? It just doesn't seem like him to be so evil, or to hold down a job.",
"It's true, Leela. Cross My Heart bra and swear to Goddess. But the Fry I know wouldn't do that. I'm gonna call his cell phone telephone and prove you wrong. Oh, no! Frida's been murdered! Not your strong suit, woman. Who could have done this? Your dad? Nixon? Fry? No, never. I don't think. Anyhow, there's a crazed murderer on the loose, possibly in the shadows or hanging from the ceiling. So just stay calm while I call Fry. So where are the Encyclopods and the Dark Ones now? When the life-giving Chee receded, only the toughest organisms could adapt and survive, like the Dark Ones.",
"Many more died out, like the Encyclopods. But, and this is the great secret of our age, left an egg behind. We're not gonna eat it! Not unless we find a second one. No, Fry, we intend to hatch it! And that's where you come in. And here I am. At long last the tide of Chee has returned, and its nourishing flow has awakened the dormant egg. It's better than good. It's better. the Encyclopod can reconstruct every species that ever went extinct. Imagine, all the animals that failed evolution's test, alive again! The dodo bird, the brittle-klutz, the striped biologist-taunter.",
"So, where is this egg? In the violet dwarf star system. And what does it look like? A violet dwarf star! You mean, the whole star is a single. Whoa! Sci-fi. Alas! Even now, a Dark One is headed to the star to ensure its destruction. Dang! So what does this Dark One look like? We don't know. I admit it's a horrifically grave situation. Don't sugarcoat it, Nine. The Dark Ones have been evolving so long, it could be anything or anyone. Or anybody. You mean, like, people? Any people.",
"It will kill the egg, and every dude, woman and child who knows about it. Even our crazy caps will be useless at close range. That's why only you, with your defective unreadable brainwave, may be able to thwart them and usher in a new green age of wonder and. You're on Fry-time. Leela! Didn't you see Frida Waterfall? kill Frida Waterfall? What? No. I told her Oh, Jeep! The Dark Ones got her. It's all true. We need to talk, Leela. Then I can explain. Well, I can't explain anything, but we should talk anyway.",
"Where are you? Oh, no. I'm not gonna expose the Honeybun Hideout. Where are you? Near the Keeler Crater on Mars. Do you know it? I think I read about it. rim in one hour. No mustaches. Kif, set coordinates, 36-24-36. Ten minutes late. Ain't that just like a womanista? Are you alone? Of course, don't you trust me? There's no escape, Leela. If you surrender, wave your shirt in the air. Fry, you traitor! AMY OVER Hop onto the magnet, Leela! Okay. One, two. I can't believe you ratted me out, Fry.",
"I'm not a rat, I swear. If I'm any rodent, it's the loyal capybara, king of the rats! No, wait. This just in, we are about to get our asses blown off. Labarbara? That's right, Linda. Stay strong, ladies. We can lose them in the giant miniature golf course. But the course isn't finished. And there's no girls allowed. Fore! So, they want to play mini golf, eh? Two can play at that game. Or even four, depending on the number of ball colors available. I choose pink. That's their color, sir.",
"They're gaining on us. We need a birdie on the windmill hole. Drop the boot! Sir, at our present speed, the computer predicts a 100 % chance we'll be sliced in half. We'll never make it. Not with that attitude, we won't. We made it through, Kif. How many men did we lose? Well, at least they won't have to mourn each other. Seal the airlocks, and draw the shades. Resume shooting. Oh, no! The gorilla! That's a par-four! The mouth's too dangerous. I'm going for the nose. Don't be a sucker.",
"You won't come out anywhere near the hole. You need to aim for the jaws just when they start to close. Start to close? Are you out of your. Captaining 101. Go for the nose. My arms are broken, I'll never paint again. You can't sue the military. I'm okay then. Damage report. We lost all remaining food and oxygen, Captain. As well as our XM Radio antenna. Then this chase is over. Kif, set course for the nearest XM repair facility. Meanwhile, we shall sing top hits from the'80s.",
"Which'80s, sir? For me, there are only one'80s. Smell like I sound I'm lost and I'm found And I'm hungry like the wolf We're jamming straight for the hole. We're gonna crash, even. shmeverybody. It's a wormhole hole. Of course, a wormhole! We'll simply disappear and reappear in another part of the universe. Crud nuggets! We de-spaced right next to the Nimbus. Just when you think the chase is over, it gets twice as exciting! My bloodhound-like instincts must have hunted them down while my other parts were throbbing to Duran Duran.",
"Shall I initiate a pointless and potentially fatal pursuit? It's gonna be fun on a bun, in space. Look! The asteroid. Now it's crawling with life. Like Zoidberg's sandals! Wow! It's incredible. But it'll be destroyed when Leo Wong blows up the violet dwarf. So why are you helping him? I can't tell you, Leela. You just have to trust me. You keep saying that, something to go on or I. The out-of-fuel indicator. It's indicating. Say, what's that violet-colored dwarf-like star thing we're drifting into? The violet dwarf star! Of course.",
"The gorilla was the 18th hole, so we're headed into the ball return. What else now can go wrong? Ladies, you're under arrest. Prepare to be boarded again and again. He'll never take me alive. Don't give up yet. I've got one more trick up my sleeve. That's exactly the number we need. The fairer sex. Something's very wrong here, and yet a little bit right. Not so fast, Brannigan. Even less fast, feministas! Bender? All two tons of me. All rise for the honorable Chief Justice D-O-G-G and the Associate Justices.",
"Yo. Seat it or beat it. The charges against y'all femditos is murder, mayhem, vandalism, kidnapping and resisting arrest. Damn! The big five. You may now make your opening. What you got to say for yourselves? May it please the Court. I mean, may it plizzle the cozizzle. Proceed. These charges are outrageous. Our only goal was to save a rare violet star and its precious ecosystem. If protecting the environment is a crime, then. Protecting the environment is a crime. I rest my mouth.",
"Do you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth? I. Well, now, I. Am I under oath when I take the oath? Can the witness identify the feminista leader? That's her right there, with the I'm gonna kill you Benderlook in her eye. Hey, aren't you the robot who robbed me at gunpoint last year? No further answers, Your Honor. Please, Justice Dogg, Leela and her friends are completely innocent. Hold up. Were you or were you not abducted by these hoes? Well, abducted is such an ugly word.",
"Mr. Wong, the court cannot compel you to testify against your own daughter. No. No, I want to. Also, I got something to say about my wife. Having heard some of the testimony over these jams I've been listening to, me and my crew will now kick it in the mix. All right. We got us a verdict up in this High Court. Bailiff, drop it like it's legal precedent. In the matter of Leo Wong v. The Greenorita Eco-Feminist Collective, four justices vote to convict, However, since the vote was strictly along gender lines and the female justices' votes only count half, you are hereby found guilty.",
"It's a humiliating and biased system, but it works. Fifty years in the maximum security Dogg house. Beats Nutley on a Saturday night. This is a privately-owned for-profit prison, and I run a tight, cheap ship! I've done this by cutting cost everywhere, especially on punishment. I rely on you inmates to make prison unpleasant for yourselves. You're encouraged to sexually harass new prisoners, organize no-holds-barred catfights and maintain poor hygiene. Try and make me, copper. A troublemaker.",
"With the feministas in You and me, Fry. We implode the violet dwarf star tomorrow. You and me? Tomorrow? Tomorrow. Hello? Madfellows? I need to. Okay, Leo Wong's about to destroy the violet dwarf. So, whatever I need to know to stop him, tell me now. Alas! Stopping Wong isn't the only problem. One of the Dark Ones will try to stop you from stopping him. So, you must stop it from stopping you from stopping him. But how can I stop The name Omega Devicesort of conjured up something cooler-looking.",
"Not that I'm disappointed or anything. The important thing is what's inside. No one knows, man. It was invented by a blind inventor, and the one dude he described it to was deaf. So the legend goes. When activated, the device will emit a localized blast of delta-band noise to momentarily disable the Dark One. Like farting in a tent? No, an elevator. strike the enemy at point blank range! But the Dark One could look like anything or anyone, right? Or anywhere. So, what's your plan to recognize it? We don't have one.",
"And we don't dare think of one neither.'Cause if we do, the Dark Ones might sense kind of the general vibe. Even through our mighty foil. Oh, man! Anyone got some tape or some gum? As my colleague indicated, the plan cannot come from us, Fry. We were counting on you and your unreadable brain to come up with something. I see that now. Freaky thing is, the Dark Ones' thoughts are unreadable, just like yours. Yes, if we dared unwrap our heads, we could easily locate the one other being whose mind we can't read.",
"The Dark One! But then the Dark One would read our minds and crush them like blood pumpkins. Wait. I can read minds and my mind can't be read. I have a plan. Great. Whatever it is, don't tell us. Wait. Fry can read minds and his mind can't be read. So he can safely scan for the Dark One. Leela, time is running out. We must get to the violet star. Okay, okay. Shut up, already. Nobody's talking, Leela. We're just painting each other's toenails with rat blood. Those compact fluorescent bulbs waste pennies a day.",
"Okay, feministas, all clear. We now go live to Leela with the escape plan. Thanks, Linda. Now we're in here because we tried to save endangered wildlife. endangered wildlife will save us. The Martian muck leech. That's right. He's been living off me since we got captured. Little cutie almost sucked me dry. Like a green snake through a sugarcane cake. Keep trying. Our top story. The universe's most wanted eco-feminists are now behind bars, including gang leader, Turanga Leela.",
"AKA, the Notorious B-I-Itch. We finished un-pinking the ship, Hubert. Now what? Now we get back to work. And if that means destroying an ecosystem or two, so be it. I just meant without our good friends Fry, Leela, Amy and the robot. Oh, boo-hoo. This is a business, not a social club. Money talks. True wealth is measured in friendships. Life goes on. But I believe we'll forever carry the pain on the inside. Oh, no, a rooster! That indicates it's the following morning. How's that creepy crawler doing? I'm sorry, femi-sisters, but it pooped out around 3:00 a.m.",
"Poor thing couldn't take another bite. But what matters is, we tried our best and we looked good doing it. Bender, is that you? My identical cousin Buster? You're here to break us out? But you're the one who put us in. But I'm Bender, king of the combination shot. I put you in so that by busting you out, I could commit 15 felonies at once. Put my rap sheet miles ahead of yours on the all-time chart. You are one devious bastard. That's what it says on my vanity plate. What about the sentries? Already taken care of.",
"I sent them a cake laced with nutmeg. That's a human sleeping drug, right? No, it's a human baking drug. Okay, Plan B. Everyone knows men have one fatal weakness, they can't resist hookers. Dixie, Trixie, you know what to do. Your eyes say no, but your machine gun fire says. Ladies and gentleman and whatever, welcome to my most environmentally disastrous implosion ever. A whole star system! Kif, old boy, mind if I sit on your shoulders for a better view? Well, actually, sir, I was hoping.",
"Thanks. My associate Philip Fry here will have honor to blow this ugly, dirty star into nice, clean black hole. Fry, careful those wires. What you doing down there? Just polishing your shoes, Mr. W. That nice. Get between the toes there, very dirty. Well, so much for Plan B. What's Plan C? All situations have the same Plan C. Bending, come on. We're boned, Bender. It's a brick wall. Granted, it's not on the list of approved bendables, but I'm so great! Dogs! The boning continues.",
"Green Bluebird, this is Mr. Fabulous. We are go for cheesing it. Professor! Hermes! Zoidberg! Scruffy. A janitor. Even after we locked you in a go-go cage like common go-go dancers? I couldn't live with myself, Leela. I call myself a scientist, wear the white coat and probe a monkey every now and again, yet I put monetary gain ahead of preserving nature. Can you ever forgive me? I reckon. I could kiss you, Professor. Okay, but watch out for my new grill. Before the grand finale, as it were, it seems only fitting that I, Commodore 64 Zapp Brannigan, say a few brief pages in honor of.",
"Whatever your plan is, Fry, I suggest you get on with it. sauce on my Number 9 shirt. Okay, locate the Dark One by finding someone whose thoughts I can't read. And unaccustomed. I'm the greatest speaker of all time. They're suckling at the teats of my every syllable. Allow me now. His voice is like ear sandpaper. The one secret no one ever suspected is that I really did stage the moon landing. On Venus. If I had all the money in the world, I'd.",
"Oh, wait. I do. I'd like to thank the academy, my agent, and most of all, my operating system, Windows Vista, for everything it. System error. I never should have taken that accent elimination class from Jackie Chan. And so, as we obliterize this star, let us remember those immortal words once spoken by a great man, moi. And I quote, All good things must come to an end, preferably in a humongous explosion. Ten! Nine! There's no one here whose thoughts can't be read. No one, except me! My thoughts can't be read.",
"But that's crazy. If I were the Dark One, I'd know it, wouldn't I? But, here I am, right where the Dark One would be, about to blow up the star. Oh, God! Somewhere deep inside of me, it's me! I'm the Dark One! Put your hands in the air! like we just don't care? That's optional. You girl punks gone too far this time. Your parents should be ashamed. Destroy the star, Leo, hurry. You got it, Mr. Voice-in-my-head. you got a pretty good swing. Really? Thanks, Dad. this star cracker once and for all.",
"You're making a mistake. You have no idea what's really going on. What is really going on? I can't tell you. Then why should I trust you? Why? You're you. That's all I need to know. No! Don't do it! Leela, are you crazy? and jail-breakers to stop him. And hookers, don't forget hookers. Shame on all of you. After everything we've been through together, do you really think Fry would. I destroy myself to save you. Where's the boom? I was expecting a boom. It didn't work. I'm the Dark One, and it didn't do anything.",
"You're not the Dark One, I am. Not Leela, you moron. Me! I am the Dark One. The very last Dark One. I couldn't read your mind? Oh, I am momentarily disabled. What's happening out there? Somethings wondersful. The star and the asteroid. They were an egg and a sperm. Great modem of mercy. Cover the children's eyes. There are no children here. Then move your fat head. I can't see. The Encyclopod is reborn. A new green age has begun! So the legend foretold. Look! Inside its pouch.",
"Extinct Tasmanian tigers. And dodo birds. And white rhinos. And striped biologist-taunters. What are you gonna do, shoot us? These once extinct plants and animals are my gift to the universe. Through untold generations, my race has treasured their DNA. Treat them wisely with the knowledge that all species are precious. This is unbelievable. What's going on? To answer that, I must tell you a story. A story of two alien species so ancient that. Hutch, are you okay? My sister's femi-necklace.",
"Hey, how come I can't read your thoughts anymore? I shall avenge you, Hutch Waterfall. After all these eons, the Dark Ones are no more. Will you preserve their DNA, O Great Encyclopod? Wait, where did it go? Well, at any rate, I shall preserve the DNA of Homo sapiens. I thought you only saved the DNA of endangered species. Farewell. I guess he didn't hear me. Well, looks like that wraps everything up in a nice big, old, fat sack of. I hereby arrest you fugitives on 53 counts of fugivity."
